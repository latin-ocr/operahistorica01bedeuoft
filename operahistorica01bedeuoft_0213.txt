LET' Γ ER TO ETHELBERT

the people subject unto you, increase the zeal of
your righteousness in their conversion, set yourself
against the worshipping of idols, overthrow the
buildings of their temples,¹ edify the manners of
your subjects by the great purity of your life, with
words of exhortation, sear, fair speech, correction
and shewing example of well-doing: that you may
find Him to be your rewarder in heaven, whose
knowledge and name you make to be enlarged
upon the earth. For He will Himself also make
your name the more famous unto posterity, whose
honour you seek and maintain among the nations.

“For so Constantine, being sometimes a most
religious emperor, called the Roman commonwealth
from the corrupt worshipping of idols and brought it
with himself under the obeisance of the Almighty
God our Lord J esus Christ, turning to Him with his
whole mind together with them that were subject
to his rule. Whereby it was brought to pass that
his name was of higher renown than any of the
princes that went before him, and so much in glory
excelled his aneestors, how much also he passed
them in well-doing. Wherefore let your highness
also hasten now to spread among the kings and
countries subject to your dominion the knowledge
of one God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost‚
to the intent thereby you may pass in honourable
fame the ancient kings of your nation, and how
much the more you wipe out also the sins of other
among your subjects, you may have also so much
the less sear of your own sins before the dreadful
bench of Almighty God’s justice.
