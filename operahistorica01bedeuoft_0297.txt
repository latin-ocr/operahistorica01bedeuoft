Anour which time he haply received from Boniface,

the saith, of which the form is such:

Copy of the letter of the most blessed and apostolic
pope of the church of the city of Rome, Boniface,
unto the puissant prince Edwin king of the English.l

“ To the puissant prince Edwin king of the English,
Boniface, bishop‚ servant of the servants of God.

“ Although the power of the supreme divinity
cannot be expressed by the employment of words of
man (for it consisteth by the greatness thereos of so
unspeakable and unsearehable eternity‚ that no
keenness of wit is able to comprise and expound how
great it is) ε yet for as much as the lovingkindness of
God, opening the gates of the heart to the entry of
itself‚ doth mercifully pour into men's minds by
secret inspiration such things as shall be revealed
concerning itself3 we have thought good to extend
our episcopal care in uttering unto you the rich
store of the Christian saith, that bringing likewise
also unto your understanding the Gospel of Christ,
which our Saviour commanded to be preached to all
nations‚ we may offer you the means of your salva—
tion. The mercy, therefore, of the high majesty of
God, who with the only word of His commandment
hath founded and created all things, the heaven to

pope do not seem always conciliatory, and are in parts diffi-
cult to translate, either because the copies made were incor-
rect, or because the pope himself had not revised the Latin.
