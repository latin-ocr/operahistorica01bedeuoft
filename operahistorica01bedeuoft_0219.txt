ABBOT PET ER

to have been there built of old by the work of
Romans which believed, and did dedicate it in the
name of the Holy Saviour God and our Lord Jesus
Chris t, and there made a house for him and all his
successor.s1 And not far from the city itself east-
ward he builded also a monastery2 in the which
Ethelbert through his advice builded from the
foundations a church in the honour of the blessed
apostles Peter and Paul. and enriched it with
sundry gists, in which both the body of Augustine
himself and of all the bishops of Canterbury as well
as also of the kings of Kent might be interred.
Which chuich yet not Augustine himself, but
Laurentius his successor did consecrate. Moreover,
the first abbot of the same monastery was one
Peter, a priest‚ which being sent legate unto Gaul
was drowned in a creek of the sea called Amfleatf·
and buried after a homely manner of the inhabitants
of the same place. But Almighty God intending
to have it known how worthy a man he was, made
that every night there appeared a light from heaven
upon the place where he lay buried, until the neigh-
bours about, which saw the light, gathering thereby
that he was some holy man that was buried there,
and searching out what and from whence he was,
removed his body from thence, and buried it in the
church⁴¹ in the town of Bouloffne according to the
honour convenient for so worthy a person.
