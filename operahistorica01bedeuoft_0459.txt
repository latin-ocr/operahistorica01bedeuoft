FURSA AND SIGBERT

Who coming to the country of the East English was
honourably received of the said king, and pursuing
his accustomed work of preaching the Gospel he
wrought with many, both by the example of his
goodness and the urgency of his preaching, either
eonverting unbelievers to Christ or strengthening
further in the faith and love of Christ them that already
believed.

And being seized there with a certain sickness of
body he was counted worthy to have the joy of an
angelice vision wherein he was warned to press on
earnestly in the ministry of the word, which he had
begun, and pei-severe unweariedly in his accustomed
watching and praying3 for that his end was certain,
but the coming hour of the same end was uncertain,
according to the saying of the Lord:1 “ Watch
therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.''
Being strengthened with which vision he hastened
with all speed to build up a monastery in the place
king Sigbert had given him and to give instruction
thei-ein to regular discipline. Now the monastery
was pleasantly situated for the woods and sea
adjoffiing, being erected in a castle which in the
tongue of the English is called Cnobheresburg, that
is the city of Cnobhere; 2 which afterwards Anna the
king of that country and all the noble men enriehed
with buildings of more majesty and with offerings.
Moreover, this Fursa came of the noblest race of
the Scots, but he was far nobler of mind than of birth
of the flesh. From the very time of his childhood
he gave no small pains to the reading of the Scriptures
and monastica] discipline, and as especially becometh
holy men, all things that he had learned ought to be
done, he was diligent in endeavouring to execute.
