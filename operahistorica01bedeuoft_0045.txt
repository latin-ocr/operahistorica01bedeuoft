OF THE VENERABLE BEDE'S

ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY OF THE
ENGLISH NATION

PREFACE

TO THE MOST GLORIOUS KING CEOL-

WULF,l BEDE THE SERVANT OF CHRIST
AND PRIEST

Tim history of things done in the Church of the
English 2 nation, which of late I had set forth, I did
both first on your desire very gladly send your
Grace to have a sight and proof thereos, and now
do send it to you again, to the intent you may copy
it out and more fully at your leisure consider it:
and Ι cannot but highly commend this your un-
feigned zeal‚ not only to give diligent ear to the
words of Holy Scripture, but also exercise a watch-
ful care to know of things done or spoken by worthy
men before your time, and specially of our own
country. For whether an history shall contain good
things concerning good men, the careful hearer is
thereby stirred up and provoked to follow after
well-doing3 or whether it shall report evil things
concerning froward men, the devout and well-disposed
hearer or reader none the less, by flying that is evil
and noisome to his soul. is himself moved thereby
more earnestly to follow after the things he knoweth
