Bede was a Saxon. He was, says Fuller, wanting
in charity to the Britons, and at any rate it may be
admitted that his sympathy ’with them was imperfect.
He has little pity for the slaughter of the British
monks at Chester,1 and in noting the unfriendliness
of the British clergy towards the Roman mission he

Britons had to hate their Saxon conquerors. This
lack of sympathy does not apply to the British
Church before the days of the Saxon invasion, while

learning of its schools, to the example of Iona and
Lindisfarne and the devoted labours of men like
Columba and Aidan‚ in spite of ecclesiastica] differ-

generations, is his Eeclesiastical History, which was
only completed in the last years of his life. The
first book begins with a summary of the early history
of the country and of the Church in Britain down to
the coming of Augustine, and ends with the death of
Gregory, who had sent the Roman missionaries to

the memory of the great pope, narrates the failure of
the overtures for union made to the British and Irish
Churches‚ and ends with the death of Edwin, king

of Northumbria, in whose reign Paulinus introduced
Christianity into that countr3. The third book

mission under Aidan‚ and ends w1th the despatch
of Wighard to be consecrated archbishop of Canter-
