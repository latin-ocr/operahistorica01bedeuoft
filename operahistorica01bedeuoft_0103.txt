cities which were made for sear of the enemy, in
the same place where Severus before had cast the
trench: which wall indeed (which even to this day
remaineth famous and to be seen) they did build
with public and private chargeS, the Britons also

cities and the wall they fly, and they are scattered.
The enemy followeth upon thern, hasteth to slay
more cruelly than ever he did before. For even as
