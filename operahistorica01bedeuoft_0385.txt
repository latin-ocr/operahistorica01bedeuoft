religious houses were afterwards built in addition
by his scholars both in Britain and in Ireland: of

wherein his body lieth, is the head house.

Moreover, the same isle is always wont to have an
abbot that is a priest to be the ruler, to whose law
both the whole district 1 and also the bishops them-
selves ought, after an unaccustomed order, to be
subject, according to the example of that first teacher
who was no bishop, but a priest and a monk 2 of whose
life and sayings the report is that some things remain
written by his scholars.2 But yet what manner of
man so ever he was, we know this of him for a surety,
that he left successors, men that excelled in con-
tinency and love of God and practice of religious life :
in observing in deed the time of the high feast of
Easter they followed uncertain cycles‚ and no marvel,
considering that, being men set so far removed from
the rest of the world, no man sent unto them the
decrees made in synods³ for the keeping thereof :
they diligently observed only such works of devotion
and chaste conversation as they could learn in the
Prophets‚ the Gospels and in the Apostles’ writings.
Now this keeping of Easter remained no small time
with them, that is to wit, until the 715th year of the
Lord's incarnation, by the space of 150 years.

But when the most reverend and holy father and
priest Egbert 4 came to them from the English nation‚
living in Christ’s quarrel in exile long time in Ireland‚
and being 3 man very well learned in the Scriptures

have seen, wrote a life of Columba, which Bede does not seem

to have known, Pl.
