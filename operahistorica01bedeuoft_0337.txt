SIGBERT THE LEARNED

dured so unto his day and witnessed that he saw it
in his childhood.

Now the aforenamed king Redwaffl, being noble in
birth although ignoble in deed, was son of Tytilus,
whose father was Wuffa, from whom the kings of the
East English are called Wuffings. But Earpwald
not long ‘’after he had received the saith was slain
by a man that was a paynim named Ricbert3 and
from that time three years after the province abode
in error, until Sigbert, brother 1 of the same Earpwald‚
took the kingdom, a man in all points most Christian
and learned, who, whiles his brother was yet alive,
living banished in France was instructed in the mys-
teries of the faith3 of which he went about to make
all his realm partaker as soon as he began to reign.
Whose good endeavour herein the bishop Felix
farthered to his great glory, and when Felix came
from the coasts of Burgundy (where he was born and
took holy orders) to Honorius the archbishop, and
had opened his longing unto him, the archbishop sent
him to preaeh the word of life to the aforesaid nation
of the East English. Where certes his desires fell
not in vain3 nay rather this good husbandman of
the spiritual soil found in that nation manifold fruit
of people that believed. For according to the good
abodement of his name 2 he brought all that province,
now delivered from their long iniquity and unhappi-
ness, unto faith and works of justice, and the gifts of
unendjng happiness3 and he received the see of his
bishoprie in the city of Domnocz³ where, when he
had ruled the same province seventeen years in that
dignity, he ended his life in peace in the same place.
