CHAPTER XXI

How the province of the Uplandislz English was made
Christian under king Peada [653]

AT this time the Middle Englishmen‚1 that is the
Uplandish English, received the saith and the
myster-ies of truth under their prince Peada, the son
of king Penda: who being an excellent young man,
and worthy of the name and dignity of king, was
of his father advanced to the govermnent of that
nation3 and he came to Oswy king of the Nor-thum-
bnans, requiring Alchfled his daughter to be given
him to wife ε but could in no otherwise obtain his suit
unless he would receive the faith of Christ and
baptism, together with the nation over which he was
set. Thereon, having heard the preaching of the
truth, the promise of the heavenly kingdom and the
hope of resurrection and immortality to come, he
willingly avouched that he was ready to become a
Christian, even though he should not win the maiden t
being chiefly persuaded to receive the saith by king
Oswy’s son, called Alehfrid, who was his brother-in-
law 2 and friend, having to wife Peada’s sister, by
name Cyneburg, king Penda’s daughter.

He was therefore baptized by Finan the bishop,
with all the retainers and thanes who had come
with him, and the whole of their servants, in a famous
town of the king‘s which is called At Wall.³ And he
returned home with much joy, having taken four
priests who secmed fit both by learning and conduct

³ Walton or Walbottle near Newcastle.
