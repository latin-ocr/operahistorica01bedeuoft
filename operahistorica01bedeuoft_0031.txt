INTRODUCTION

Norman Conquest, and Bishop Browne’s lee Venerable
Bede, S.P.C.K. Maitland's Darlc Ages describes
the state of religion and literature in the centuries
suceeeding Bede’s time. The early authorities for
the period of Bede’s History will be found in
Monumenta Historica Britannica, 1848.

The Latin text of the present edition is that of
Moberly, Oxford, 1881, which is practieally Smith’s
text. Alterations taken from Plummer’s edition,
as well as notes which have been borrowed have
been acknowledged with the letters Pl. Dr. Bright’s
lectures are referred to as Briglzt, and Oman’s His tory
as oman. Matter that is common to different
editors has not been specially aeknowledged. The
present editor has had the advantage, for which
he must express his gratitude‚ of being allowed to
use Dr. H. F. Stewart's notes for the introduction as
well as his corrections of Stapleton’s translation.
He has had too the advantage of using Dr. Stewart’s
version of the Lines of the Abbots, and the Letter io
Egbert. Further, for the translation of Cuthbert’s
letter on Bede's last days he had Plummer's trans-
lation before him, and in the identification of place
names and other points he has had valuable help
from Professor Mawer and Mr. Welldon Finn. The
spelling of Saxon names in the translation is mainly
that of Plummer.

These aeknowledgments are so many that it may
well be asked what is left for the present editor to
claim as his own. He ean only hope that he has not
spoilt what he has ventui-ed to touch, and can only
plead that, in adapting the work of others to his own
view of what might best secure uniformity of style,
he has probably spent as much time as if he had
attempted to give a version entirely his own.
