HEALING OF BOTHELM

Christian saith, no church‚ no altar was set up in all
the country of the Bel-niciam, before that this new
captain of warfare, at the bidding of his devout saith,
did set up this banner of the holy cross, as he was
going to give battle to his terrible enemy.

And it is not amiss to relate fully one marvellous
mighty work out of many which have been wrought
at this cross. One of the brethren of Hexham chin-eh,
called Bothelm, who liveth yet at this day, a few years
past,wheninthe nighthe was stepping heedlessly upon
iee‚ suddenly falling down crushed his arm, and began
to be so vexed with the grievous trouble of the hurt
thereof, that for vehemency of pain he was not even
able to bring his arm in any way to his mouth. And
this man,hearing one morning that one of the brethren
had appointed to go up to the place of the same
holy cross, prayed him that at his return he would
bring him a piece of that venerable wood, saying that
he believed that he could thereby by the gift of the
Lord gain his health. The brother did as he was
desired· , and when he was come home again about
evening, the brethren being now set at the table to
eat, he gave the afflicted party some of the old moss
that was grown upon the overmost part of the wood.
Who sitting then at table and having at hand no
better place to lay up the gift wherewith he was pre-
sented, put it into his bosom. And when he went to
bed, forgetting to put this moss anywhere else he let
it remain in his bosom. But at midnight he waked‚
and feeling a eold thing lying near to his side
and moving his hand thereto to find what that
should be, he found his arm and hand whole and
sound, as if he had never had aught of such great
feebleness.
