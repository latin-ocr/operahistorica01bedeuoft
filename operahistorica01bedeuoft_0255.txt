SLAUGHTER OF MONKS

divided into 7 companies, with each company his
several assigned ruler, none of these companies had
less than 300 persons, who did all ever live by the
labour of their own hands. A great number there-
fore of them, after three days' fasffing, had come with
others to the aforesaid army to pray for the soldiers,
having by them a defender named Brocmail who
should keep them from the swords of the barbarians
while they thus earnestly bent to their prayers.
And when king Ethelfrith had understood the cause
of their coming thither, he said: ‘⁶ Then if these
men cry and call upon their God against us, truly
though they themselves have no armour, yet they
fight against us, who pursue us with curses to bring
evil upon us.'' Accordingly he commanded his
soldiers to assault these men first, and so he van-
quished after the other parts of this detestable host,
but yet not without a great loss of his own men. It
is reported that there were slain in that battle, of
them which had corne to pray, about 1200 men, and
that only 50 escaped by ssight. Brocmail at the first
coming of the enemy turned his back with his men,
and whom he ought to have defended, these he left
without defence and naked to the strokes of the
sword. And so in this manner was fulfilled the
fiffpffisyeffifiozhg &erfflpbssssgufisslsseed (ἷξοῖἰὲ
heavenly realms), so that these heretical men learnt
by the vengeance also of temporal death, that they
had despised the counsels of eternal salvation
offered to them.
