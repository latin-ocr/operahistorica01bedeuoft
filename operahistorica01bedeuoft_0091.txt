MAXIMUS

CHAPTER lx

Hom that in the reign of Gratian, NIaaeimus being made
emperor in Britain returned to Gaul with a great
army.

Tm: 377th1 year of the incarnation of our Lord,
Gratian, the 4oth emperor after AugustuS, reigned
6 years after the death of Valens, though for long
before he reigned also with Valens his uncle and
Valentinian his brzother which, seeing the state
of the eommonw ealth miserably plagued and nigh
altogether decayed, was driven of necessity for the
better repairing of the commonwealth to bestow
the imperial purple upon Theodosius, a Spaniard
born, at Syrmiumâ€š and set him over the government
of the East and Thrace together. In which time
one Maximus passed over into Gaul, a valiant man
and a good, and worthy of the dignity of Augustus,
had it not been that contrary to his oath and
allegiance he had risen by usurpation, half in manner
against his will being created emperor by the army
in Britain. After slaying in Gaul Gratiam Augustus
(which was circumvented by cunning wiles and
suddenly stolen upon, that he was affrighted and was
in mind to pass into Italy), Maximus chased Valen-
tinian Augustus his brother out of Italy. V alentinian
fleeing for succour into the East, and there with all
fatherly piety being received of Theodosius, was also
shortly restored unto the empire3 while Maximus
the tyrant, being shut up by siege within the walls
of Aquileia, was there taken and slain by them.
