ESSEX REGAINED

all parts brought both people and the foresaid king
to the way of righteousness again : so that abandoning
and throwing down their temples and the altars they
had made, they opened the churches and confessing
gladly the name of Christ, which they had gainsayed,
they chose rather to die in Him with saith in resurrec-
tion than to live amongst idols in the filth of unbelief.
Which things being so brought to pass both the

ρι’ἰῗῐε themselves and their teachers returned home
wit joy.
