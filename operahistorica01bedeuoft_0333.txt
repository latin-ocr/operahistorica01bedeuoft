BAPTISMS BY PAULINUS

sons both which he had in his banishment by dame
Quenberga, daughter 1ο Cearl king of 1116 Marchmen.

In time following his other children also which he
had by queen Ethelberga were baptized, as his son
Ethelhun and his daughter Ethelthryth and a second
son Wuscfrea, of 1116 which 1116 two first were taken
out of this life while still in 111611 white garmen'cs of
baptism, and buried in 1116 church 31 York. Yffi
