to Rome, there to counsel with the apostolic pope
Boniface 2 for necessary causes of the English
Church. And whenas the same most reverend pope
called a synod of the bishops of Italy to appoint
some order as concerning the life of monks and their
quiet state, Mellitus also himself sat amongst them
the 8th year of the reign of the emperor Focas, the
13th indiction, and the 27th day of February :‚Å∏ that
what things so ever were decreed according to rulc,
he also by subscribing thereunto might confirm
them with his authority, and returning to Britain
might bring them with him to the English churches
to 'oe committed to them and observed, as also
beside epistles which the same bishop of Rome
wrote and sent to the archbishop Laurence beloved
of God and all the clergy, and likewise also to king
Ethelbert and the English nation. This is the
Boniface which was the 4th bishop of Rome after
blessed Gregory, who by earnest suit obtained of
the emperor Focas a temple at Rome to be granted
to the Church of Christ, which temple of ancient
time was called Pantheon, as it were to stand for all
the gods: out of which temple this Bonifacc casting
forth all filthiness made a church therein in the
honour of the holy mother of God and all the
martyr-s of Christ beside3 that the army of devils
being shut out thence, the army of martyrs might
have there memorial.
