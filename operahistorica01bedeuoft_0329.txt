COIFI AND THE IDOLS

wherewith they were environed: ‘⁸ Marry‚” replied
he, “ I will. For who now to the good example of all
men can better than I myseff, by the wisdom given
me by the true God, destroy those things which
I have myself worshipped by foolishness? ” And
incontinently casting away vain superstition he be-
sought the king to grant him harness and a stallion
war horse whereon he might mount and come to
desti-oy the idols. For it was not before lawful for
a priest of the sacrifices either to wear harness or to
ride on other than a mare. Girded therefore with
a sword about his loins he took a spear in his hand,
and mounting the king-’s war horse set forth against
the idols. Which sight when men saw they thought
he had been mad. But for all that he stayed not to
profane the temple, as soon as he approached near
unto it, casting thereupon the spear which he held
in his hand3 and much rejoicing for the acknowledg-
ment of the worship of the true God he commanded
the company, which was there with him, to set fire
to and destroy the temple together with all its eoum„
Now the place where these idols sometime were is
now to be seen not far from York to the east beyond
the river Der-went, and is at the present day called
Godmunddingaham} in which place the chief priest
himself by the inspiration of the true God defiled
and destroyed the altars which he himself had con-
secrated.²
