FURSA'S DEATH

all the business of this world and also that of the
monastery itself, he left the charge of the monastery
and care of souls to his brother Foillan1 and to Gobban
and Dicul, priests, and purposed himself, being free
from all the things of the world, to end his days in
the life of an anchorite. He had a second brother,
called Uitam? who after long proof and trial of the
monastery had gone to lead the life of an eremit.

After, seeing the country disquieted by the
invasion of the heathen 3 and forecasting danger to
threaten also the monasteries‚ leaving all things in
good order, he sailed to France, and there being
honourably received of Clovis,4 the king of the
Franks, and of Ercinwald, the patrician,5 he builded
a monastery in a place called Latineaeum,⁶ and not
long after being seized with sickness he brought his
last day to a close. Whose body the same Ercinwald,
the patrician, taking kept it in a side chapel of the
church which he was making in his township which
has the name of Peronne‚ until the church itself
should be dedicated. Which being done 27 days
after and the body itself taken from the side chapel
to be laid anew by the altar, it was found to be so
uninjured as if the man had the same hour de-
parted from the light of day. Moreover, four years
after a shrine being erected at the east side of the
altar, where the body of the same man should more
honourably be tombed, it was found still without
blemish of corruption and transferred to the same
spot with fitting respect3 in the which place it is
