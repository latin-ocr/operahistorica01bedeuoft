COMING OF AUGUSTINE

well pleasing unto God religious men needeth no
man's commendation, yet because opportunity to
write did serve, we thought it good to direct our
letter to your brotherhood3 advertising you that
we have sent on this way the bearer hereos, Augustine‚
the servant of God, of whose zeal we are well assured‚
with other servants of God for the health of souls
with the help of the Lord: whom it behoveth your
holiness to help with the zeal that the order of
priesthood requireth and be forward to furnish the
comfort due unto him. And to the intent also that
you may be the better willing to favour him, we have
willed him to discover unto you priv-ily the cause
of his journey3 not doubting but, that known, with
all devotion for God's sake you will set yourself
to comfort him, because the matter so requiretli.
'We commend also unto your charity in all things
our common son Candidus, priest, whom we have
sent to oversee a small patrimony of our church.
God keep you in safety, most reverend brother.

“Dated the 23rd of July, our lord Maurice
Tiberius reigning‚ the most religious Augustus, in
the 14th year of his reign, the 13th year of the
consulship of the same our lord, in the 14fh
indiction.''
