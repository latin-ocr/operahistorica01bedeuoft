made worthy to enter into the heavenly kingdom.
Then the J udge, amazed by the sight of such wondrous
strange and &heavenly miracles, gave shortly eom-
mandment that the persecution should cease‚
beginning to give due honour ’co the slaughter of the
saints, by ‘che which he thought at first they could
be stayed from the devotion of the Christian faith.
Now the blessed Alban suffered the 22nd day of
June, nigh unto the city of Verulamiuml (which
is now of the English called V erlamacaestir or
Vaeclingacaestir), where, after, when the settled
calm of Cinistian times letulwned there was a chuich
builded of a marv ellous rich work and worthy of such
a martyrdom. In 'che which place truly even unto this
day are sick persons enred, and the doing of manifold
mighty works cease'ch not to be openly wrought.

There suffered about ’chat time Aaron and J nlius,
toxvn-dwellel·s of the City of Legions,² and many
others, both men and women, in sundry places²
which, after divers fell and crue] ‘eormen'cs and their
bodies 'corn by unheard of residing of their limbs,
yielded 'cheir souls 'co 'the joys of the heavenly city
when their warfare wag aecomplished.
