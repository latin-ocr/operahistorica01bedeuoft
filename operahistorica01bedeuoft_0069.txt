Hom Claudius was tlte second of the Romans who came
to the same land, which did also add the Orkney Isles
unio llze Roman empire. Aloreover, how Vespasian

sent bg( lum clzd subdue the Isle of Wz'glzt under the
Romans. 43 Aa).

Now in the 798th year 1 from the building of Rome,
Claudius, the fourth emperor after AugustuS‚ being
much desirous to show himself a prince profitable
unto the commonwealth, sought war on all sides and
victory whencesoever it might come. And so he
made a voyage unto Britain, which was all in a
mutiny, it seemed‚ for that such as were treacherously
fled from them were not restored. Hc passed over
into the island, whither, nor before Julius Caesar nor
after, any durst adventure, and there without battle
or bloodshed within very few days received by sub-
mission the greatest part of the island. Also he
brought into subjection to the Roman empire the
Orkney Isles 2 which lieth in the ocean above
Britain, which done he returned to Rome the sixth
month after that he departed thence, and caused
his son to be sumamed Britannicus. And this war
was brought to an end in the fourth year of his
empire3 which was the 46th year of the incarnation
of our Lord: in the which year also there fell a
great famine throughout all Syria, which in the Acts
of the Apostles ³ is shewed to be fore-spoken by the
mouth of Agabus the prophet.
