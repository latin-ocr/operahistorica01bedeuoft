OSWIN AND AIDAN

of a mare dearer in your sight than that son of God? ’¹
Which being said they entered for to dine. And
the bishop for his part took his place appointed.
Then the king, for he had come from hunting, stand-
ing with his thanes at the hearth began to warm
himself: and suddenly, as he warmed himself,
recalling the word which the bishop had spoken unto
him, he ungirded his sword, giving it to a thane,
and came in haste to the bishop, falling down at his
feet and beseeching him to be reconciled to him:
‘⁴ Because,'' said he, “ I will never hereafter speak
of this, or measure what or how much of our money
thou bestowest upon the sons of God.’' At which
sight the bishop was much afraid, and rising at once
lifted up the king, professing that he was right well
reconciled with him, provided only he should sit down
to the feast and cast away heaviness. And whilst
the king at the bishop's bidding and entreaty djd
recover cheerfulness, the bishop contrariwise began
to be made heavy even to the shedding of tears. Of
whom, when his chaplain, in his mother tongue which
the king and his court knew not, had demanded why
he wept: ‘¹ Ι know,” said he, ‘¹ that the king is not
to live long: for never before this time have I seen
an humble king. Whereby Ι perceive that he must
speedily be taken out of this life: for this people is
not worthy to have such a governor.’' And shortly
after, the bishop’s dreadful abodement was fulfilled
with the king's cruel death, of which we have spoken
before.

Moreover, bishop Aidan himself also was taken
out of the world and received of the Lord the ever-
lasting reward of his labours, even not longer than the
12th day after the king whom he loved was slain‚ that
is to wit the 3lst day of August.
