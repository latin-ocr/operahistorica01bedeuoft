CADWALLON ’S CRUELTY

eldest of them, whom we have named, Eanfrid
took the kingdom of the Bernicians. Each of which
kings, when the lot of the diadem of an earthly
kingdom fell to him, execrated and forsook the
mysteries of the heavenly kingdom in which he had

army, but feneed with the saith of Christ, the Britons’
cursed captain and that innumerable host, whereof
