PELAGIUS

CHAPTER X

Hom that Arcadius being emperor, Pelagius Bretio made
arrogant watfare against the grace of God.

T HE 394th year of the Lord’s incarnation, Arcadius,
son to Theodosius, with his brother Honorius, being
the 43rd Emperor after Augustus, reigned 13 years.
In whose time Pelagius Bretto 1 disparkled the
venom of his faithless doctrine against the aid of
heavenly grace very far abroad, using herein the
help of Julian of Campania, who was intemperately
stirred with desire to regain his lost bishoprie2:
to whom Saint Augustine, just as also the other
orthodox fathers, hath answered with many thousand
Catholic sentences, nor yet availed to correct their
folly, but (which is the weightier matter) being
rebuked for their madness they rather would increase
it by defending and maintaining it than be purified
by joining themselves to the truth: which thing
Prosper the rhetorikerss declareth nobly in heroic4
verse, saying:

“ Against Augustine crawled, ’tis told, to write
One whom the tooth of envy gnawed with spite.
Who spurred the paltry snake to leave its bed
In cavern's shelter dim and rear its head?

Their fruit the Britons gave on Ocean’s side,
Or else Campanian pastures swelled its pride.”

3 Prosper of Aquitaine died after 463.
⁴ Effigiem, called heroic also in V. 8.
