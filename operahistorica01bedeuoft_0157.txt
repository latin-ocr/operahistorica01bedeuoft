BAPTISM OF ETHELBERT

in Britain, in the which the queen (which as we have.
said was a Christian woman) did use commonly to
pray. They also themselves therefore began at
first to assemble in the same church, to sing service,
pray, say mass, preach and christen3 until such time
as, the king being converted to the saith, they
received more ample licence of preaching where
they would, and either to build of new or repair-
old churehes.

But when the king himself too among other (being
much delighted with the purity of the holy men's life
as likewise with their sweet promises which to be
true they had proved by the shewing also of many
miracles) did believe and was baptized, there began
more and more to resort together to hear the word,
and renouncing the rites of their kinsfolk to join
themselves by believing to the unity of the holy
Church of Christ. Of whose saith and conversion
though, it is said, the king much rejoiced, yet he
would force none to become Christian, but only
embrace the believers with a closer affection, as
being fellow -citizens with him of the heav enly
kingdom. For he had learned of the masters and
authors of his sal} ation that the service of Christ
must be voluntary and not forced. And without
further delay he granted to his said teachels a
place wherein to settle 1 seemly for their degree, in
his head city of Canterbury, and at the same time
bestowed on them possessions in divers kinds neces-
sary for the maintenance thereos.
