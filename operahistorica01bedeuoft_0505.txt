SYNOD OF WHITBY

in the place which is called Inhrypum3 1 which place
indeed a little before he had given to those which
followed the Scots, to have in possession for a monas-
tery. But because afterwards, when choice was
offered to them, they preferred to depart and yield
up the place rather than to change their aceustomed
manner, it was given by the prinee to him whose life

and Wilfrid, priests. On the part of these last were
James and Romanus: Hild the abbess with her
company were of the Scottish part, whereon also
was the venerable bishop Cedd long since ordained
of the Scots, as we have shewn before, who in that
assembly came foi-ward also as a most watchful
interpreter on both sides.
