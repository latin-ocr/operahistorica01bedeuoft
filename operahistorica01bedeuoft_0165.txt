some more sharply but some more lightly. And
when punishment a little more sharp is exercised‚
it must be done in charity and not in fury: for
therefore is punishment dealt to the selfsame man
that is corrected, that he might not be delivered
to the fires of hell. For so ought we to exercise
correction upon the faithful as the good fathers
useth with their carnal children, whom though they
punish with stripes for their faults, yet they seek
to have for their heirs the very same whom they
visiteth with pains3 and their possessions they
keepeth for the very same whom they seem to
chasten in their anger. This charity therefore is
to be kept in mind, and of itself enjoyneth that
correction is to be so measured that the mind
exceedeth in no way the rule of reason. Thou
shalt also tell thern in what way they must make
restitution of such things as they have taken by
theft from the churches. But God forbid that the
Church should look to receive back with increase of
gain such earthly things as it seemeth to lose, and
to be greedy of lucre from that which is vanity.''
