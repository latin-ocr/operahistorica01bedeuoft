CURE OF A HORSE

country. Whereof it carne to pass that many carried
away the very dust where his body fcll upon the
earth, and casting it into water brought much
comfort to their sick thereby. Which custom indeed
was so often practised that by little and little, as
the earth was taken away from there, a hole was
made to the measure of a man's height. And no
marvel that sick people are healed in the place
where he died, who always during his lifetime ceased
not to consider the sick and needy, to bestow alms
and to give help. And, verily, many miracles due to
his virtues are related to have been done in that
place or from the dust of that place3 but we have
thought it sufficient to rehearse only two ¹ which wc
have heard of our elders.

Not long time having passed after this prince’s
death, it fortuned a man on horseback to journey
near that place, whose horse began suddenly to
become tired, to stand still, to hang down his head
to the earth, to foam at the mouth, and with increase
of excessive pain to fall to the earth. The rider
lighted down and taking off the saddle began to
'carry fei the hour when &either he should get back
the horse in better case or leave it dead. tDBut the
bcast being of long time troubled with grievous pain,
as it tumbled itself this way and that, wallowed 111 the
end of a sudden to that place where the king of worthy
memory fell, And incontinent the pain ceasing‚ the
horse left the inordinate motions of his limbs, and
after the customable manner of horses rolling itself,
as if it had been weary‚ upon either side in turn and
forthwith rising as if whole in all ways, it began
more greedily than wont to crop the green grass of

the field.
