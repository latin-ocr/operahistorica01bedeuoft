CUTHBERT'S LETTER TO CUTHWIN

thanks to God. O truly blessed man! Moreover‚
he would recite the saying of the blessed Apostle
Paul.l ‘ It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
of the living God,’ and many other things out of
Holy Scripture, wherein he warned us to rise up from
the sleep of the soul with thinking beforehand of
our last honr, and in our own tongue beside (seeing
he was skilled in our native songs), speaking of the
dreadful departing of souls from the body,

‘ Ere he must journey
None ean be wiser
Than shall his need be,
If he but ponder
Ere his departing‚
What for his ghost may,
Evil or blessing,

After his death day,

Judgment be bringing. '

there is none more wise than there shall be need,
that· is to say, to consider, before his soul departeth
hence, after what manner it shall be judged, accord-
ing to the good or evil he hath done.'

“He ehanted also antiphons for our comfort and
his own, whereof one. is: ¹ O King of glory, Lord of
might, Who didst this day ascend above all heavens
in triumph, leave us not comfortless‚ but send unto
us, aceording to the promise of the Father, the
Spirit of truth; Hallelujah.' And when he was
come to that word, ‘ Leave us not comfortless‚' he
burst into tears and began to weep much. And
after a space he began to repeat what he had begun ;
