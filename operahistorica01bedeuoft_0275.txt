CHAPTER VI

Hom Laurence chastened by the apostle Peter converted

king Eadbald to Christ, wlco shortly after called
baclc Mellitus and Justus to preaclz.

WHEN now Laurence also was ready to go after
Mellitus and Justus and forsake Britain, he com-
manded, the very night before he went, his bed to be
laid in the church of the blessed apostles Peter and
Paul, of which church we have oftentimes before
spoken3 where, when after many his prayers and
tears poured forth to the Lord for the state of the
Church, reposing his body to rest and going to sleep,
the most blessed chief of the apostles appeared to
him, and scourging him with sharp stripes a great
while in the close and secret night, sought to know
with apostolic severity, why he should forsake the
flock which he himself had committed unto him, and
to what Shepherd, running now away himself, he
would leave the sheep of Christ beset' ln the midst of
w olves. “Hast thou,'' quoth he, “forgot mine
example, who for the little ones of Christ, which he
commended to me in token of His love, did suffer
fetters‚ stripes, imprisonings‚ afflictions, and at the
last death itself, yea the death of the cross, ij·
infidels and the enemies of Christ, that I might
myself be crowned with Christ? ” By these stripes
of the blessed Peter and these his exhortations
Laurence the servant of Jesus Christ, being stirred
up, came straightway 'co the king early in the morning
