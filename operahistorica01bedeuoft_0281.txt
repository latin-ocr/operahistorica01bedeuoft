QUENCHES A ΗΒΕ

being at length near burnt and the furious flashes
extending themselves to the bishop’s pal-ace, the
bishop trusting in God's help, where the help of
man now failed, commanded that 116 might be
carried out of his house and set against these
fierce flaws of fire flying all round about. Now
in that part where the assault of the flames fell most
sorely there was the tomb of the blessed Four
Crowned Martyrs.1 When the bishop by the hands
of his servants was brought thither, he began with
prayer, sick as he was, to drive away the peril which
the stout strength of strong men with much labour
could not before bring to pass. And behold, the
wind that blew from the south, whereby this {ire was
spread abroad over the city, now suddenly being
bent against the south, first drew off the blast of his
fury from hurting the places right over in the other
side, and straightway sinking utterly to rest stayed
his blowing, while the flames in like manner were
quieted and died out. And for as much as the man
of God did fervently burn with the fire of divine
charity‚ seeing he was wont with his often prayers
and exhortations to drive from the hurt of himself
and all his the stoi-ms of the powers of the air,2 he
might now justly prevail against the winds and
flames of the present world, and obtain that they
injured not him nor his.

And this man then, after he had ruled the Church
5 years, passed away to the heavens in the reign of
Eadbald, and was buried with his fathers in the
ost-mentioned monastery and church of the most
blessed chief of the apostles, in the 624th year of
the Lord's incarnation, on the 24th day of April.
