DEBATE IN WITAN

meeting of his wise men, he asked scverally each of
them, what manner of doctrine this seemed to them
to be, which until that day had never been heard of
before, and what they thought of the new worshipping
of divinity which was now preached. ό
To whom Coifi, the first of the king's priests, incon-
·tinently answered: “ May it like your highness to
prove what manner of doctrine this is which is now
preached unto us; but thus much I surely avouch
unto you, which I have certainly learned, that the*
religion which unto this day we have observed hath ”

your subjects hath set himself more earnestly to the
worship of our gods than I ; and yet, notwithstanding,

ν there are many of them which receive from you more

ample benefits than Ι, and higher dignities than Ι, and
better prosper in all they take in hand to do or seek
to get than I. If now the gods could aught have
done, they would rather have holpen me, who have
been careful to serve thern more zealously. Where-
fore it remaineth that, if you shall find after good
examination that these things which be now newly
preached to us be better and of more power, then
without longer delay we hasten to receive them.''
To whose wise persuasion and words another of
the king's nobles consenting forthwith added:

men here in earth (for 1116 comparison of our uncertain
time to live), as if a sparrow should come to the
house and very swiftly flit through3 which entereth
in at one window and straightway passeth out through
another, while you sit at dinner with your captains
and servantsl in winter-time3 the parlour being
then made warm with the fire kindled in the midst
