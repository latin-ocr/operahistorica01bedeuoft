that he himself too by the aiding power of our Saviour
the Lord J esus Christ may be coupled with you in
the number of Christian& and so thou mayest hold

faith?

deserved to. attain to because thou hast been born
again. Kindle ’co warm’ch the coldness of his heart
by the message of the Holy Ghost Himself3 that
when he hath set aside the numbness of the deadly
worship of idols, the heat of divine saith may enkindle
