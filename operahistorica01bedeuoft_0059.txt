THE PICTS

This island at this present, with five sundry
languages equal to the number of the books in
which the Divine Law hath been written, doth study
and set forth one and the same knowledge of the
highest truth and true majesty, that is, with the
language of the English, the Britons, the Scots,

boundaries of Britain and reacheth out to face the
north parts of Spain, albeit with wide space of water
running betwixt. The Redshanks then (as we have
said) arriving as far as Ireland in their navy, required
