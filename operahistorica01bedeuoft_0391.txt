OHOICE OF AIDAN

done anything amiss, he never for hope of honour
or fear of displeasure spared to tell them of it3
but with sharp rebuking amended them. Never was
he wont to give any money to the great men of the
world (making them only good cheer, if he had re-
ceived any to hospitality), but rather such gifts as in
money were liberally given him by rich men, he did
either (as we have said) give them in a dole for the
relies of the poor, or else he laid them out for the
ransoming of those that had been wrongfully sold.¹
Finally, many of such as he had ransomed by payment
of money he made after his scholars, and by bringing
them up in learning and virtue advanced them to the
degree of priesthood.

Now the report is that when king Oswald desired
first to have a prelate out of the province of the
Scots, who might preach the word of faith to him and
his people, another man of a more austere stomach
was first sent, who (when after a while preaching to
the English people he did nothing prevail nor was
willingly heard of the people) returned to his own
country, and so in the assembly of the elders he made
relation that in teaching he had been able to do the
people no good, to whom he had been sent, forasmuch
as they were folk that might not be tamed, and of a
hard capacity and fierce nature. Then the elders (as
they say) began in council to treat at long what were
best to be done 3 being in deeddesirous thatthe people
should have the salvation which they were asked to
give them, but sorry that the preacher whom they
had sent was not welcomed. Then Aidan (for he also
was himself present at the council) saith unto the
priest whose case was in question: “ Methinketh‚
brother,that you have been more rigorous than reason
