CUTHBERT’S LETTER TO CUTHWIN

space the boy said: ⁸ Now it is written.' Where-
upon he said: ‘ Well hast thou spoken truth3 it is
finished. Take my head in thy hands, for it de-
lighteth me much to sit opposite my holy place,
wherein Ι was wont to pray, 'chat so too as Ι sit I
may call upon my Father.’ And thus upon the
floor of his cell, singing ‘ Glory be to the Father‚
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,’ when he
had named the Holy spirit, he drew his last breath3
and so he passed to the heavenly realms.

“ Now all they which heard and saw the death of the
blessed father avowed that they had never seen any
other end his life in so great devoutness and peace:
for, as thou hast heard, so long as his soul was in the
body, he sang ⁸ Glory be to the Father ' and sundry
other spiritual songs, and with outstretched hands
ceased not to give thanks to the living and true
God. Moreover, you must know, my dear brosshen
that I could report many things about him, yet my
unlearned tongue causeth my words to be brief.''
