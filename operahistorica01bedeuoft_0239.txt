GREGORY AND BRITAIN

denied to poor men their desire, and have made the
eyes of the widow look long for her help. If I have
eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless child hath
not eaten thereos with me. For from mine infancy
mei-ey hath grown with me and out of my mother's
womb it came forth with me.''

To the work of this Gregory’s piety and righteous-
ness this pertaineth also, that he hath made our
nation, by preachers which he sent hither, to be
partakers of eternal liberty, wresting us from the
teeth of our old enemy: and rejoicing with our saith
and salvation‚ and commending the same with
worthy praise, he saith thus in his exposition of
blessed Job: “ Behold the tongue of Britain, which
once knew nothing but to gnash the teeth rudely‚
hath long since begun to sing the Hebrew Alleluia in
giving praise to God. Behold the ocean sea once
swelling high, now made calm, obeyeth to the feet of
holy men3 and the furious floods thereof which
earthly princes with force could never fray, the same
for fear of God the lips of priests doth bind with
bare words; and though that sea had no sear at all
of the unbelieving hosts of fighting men, yet doth it
now tremble at the tongues of humble believers.
For whereas by receiving of heavenly words and the
manifest shewing forth of miracles beside, the
excellency of the knowledge of God is poured into
it, by the terror of that same divine nature it is so
bridled that now it feareth to act frowardly and most
earnestly desireth to come to the grace of eternity.’'
By which words the blessed Gregory declareth this
also, that holy Augustine and his company brought
the English nation to the knowledge of truth, not by
preaching to them of words only but also by shewing
them heavenly signs.
