PREFACE

and how the two said fathers both lived and died,
we have diligently learned of the brothers of the
monastery named Lastinghaml by the said two
erected. Furthei more the things done 1n the Church
throughout the province of the East English we
have learned partly from the writings or tradi-
tions of men of former time, partly by the relation
of the most reverend abbot Esi.2 But as for such
things as were done in the territory of Lindsey³
touching the furtherance of the faith of Christ, or
what bishops there succeeded from time to time, we
have learned either by the writings of the most
reverend bishop Cynibert,⁴1 &thero by the lively
voice of other men of good c1·edit.5M01e0ve1 the
ecclesiastical history of the province of the North-
umbrians, throughout the divers divisions ther,eof
from the time they received the saith of Christ
unto this present Ι have gotten, not by any one
author but by relation of innumerable faithful
witnesses which might know and remember the same,
besides all that by my own experience I might know.
Among which you shall note that such things as I
have wrote of the most holy father and bishop
Cuthbert ὅ either in this book, either in the treatise
that I have made of his life and acts, Ι have taken
partly out of those things which I found before
written of him by the brothers of the church of
Lindisfarne‚ following simply the saith of the history
which I read3 but partly also have been careful to
add skilfully thereunto such things as I could learn
myself by the sure testimony of men of good credit.
And Ι humbly beseech the reader, that if he shall
find anything set down otherwise than truth in this
that I have written, he will not impute it unto us,
