EDWIN'S RULE

reverence. He had, moreover‚ in the ministry with
him one J ames a deacon, a man certes of industry
and great fame in Christ and the Church, who lived
even unto our time.

Now in those days such is stated to have been the
tranquillity throughout Britain, which way so ever
the rule of king Edwin had reached, that (as it is yet
to-day in a common proverb), even if a woman should
have wished to walk along with her newborn babe
over all the island from sea to sea, she might have
done so without injury from any. The same king
did so much tender the comfort of his people‚ that
in most places where he saw clear well-springs
breaking out by the side of the highways‚ he bade
posts be set up and copper vessels hung thereon for
the refreshing of wayfaring men, which vessels
either for greatness of fear of the king’s displeasure
no men durst touch further than to his present use
and need, or would wish to touch for greatness of
the love they bare him. Moreover, he had such
excellency of glory in the kingdom that not only in
battle were banners borne before him, but in timo
of peace too a standard-bearet· was accustomed to
go before him whensoever he rode 1 about the cities,
townships or shires with his thanes3 yea, even when
he passed through the streets to any place there was

wont to be carried before him that kind of banner
which the Romans call Tufa 2 but the English Tuus.
