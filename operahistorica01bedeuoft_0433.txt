CURE OF IRISH SCHOLAR

by the help of them which have faithfully served God:
He will vouchsafe to be reconciled to me that am a
wretch unworthy of pardon. Now we have heard
and it is very commonly reported that there hath
been in your nation a king of wonderful holiness,
called Oswald‚ the excellency of whose faith and
virtue, yea, after death, hath become well known by
the performance of many mighty works: and I
beseeeh you, if you have any of his relies in your
keeping, to bring it to me, in case it may be so
that the Lord will be pleased to have mercy upon
me through his merits.' VVhereupon I made answer:
⁶ Forsooth, I have some of the tree whereupon his
head was stuck after that he was slain of the pay-
nims; and if thou wilt believe steadfastly in thine
heart, the merciful goodness of God by the merits
of so worthy a person can both grant thee longer
time to lead this life and also make thee a meet man
to enter into the life evei-lasting.' And he answered
me incontinent that he did perfectly believe so.

“ Then I blessed water, and casting in a chip of
the foresaid oak-wood did give to the sick man to
drink. And forthwith he did begin to amend and
recovering his health from that sickness lived a long
time after: and being turned to God in all heart and
deed, did publicly declare to all men, wherever he
came, the graciousness of our merciful Maker and
the glory of His faithful servant.”
