was careful in the same letter to warn them to beware
of and eschew the Pelagian heresy which he had
learned did begin to rise again amongst them3
the beginning of which epistle is this:

“ To the well beloved and most holy Tomene‚
Colman, Cronan, Dima and Baeithin, bishops3
Cronan, Ernan, Laisren‚ Scellan and Seghine, priests 3

and the primicerius notariorum acted as vicegerents of tho
Roman see. Notarius means shorthand writer, Pl.
