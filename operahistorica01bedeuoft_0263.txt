catholic observation with that Church of Christ
which was spread over all the whole world; of which
epistle namely the beginning is as follows:

‘⁴ To our dearest brethren the bishops and abbots
throughout all scotland} Laurence, Mellitus and
Justus bishops, servants of the servants of God.
Whenas the see apostolic (according to the accus—
tomed manner thereos as it doth in all parts of the
world) sent us to preach to paynim people in these
western parts, and so it happened us to enter into
this isle which is called Britain; where thinking,
before we had experience, that men walked accord-
ing to the customed way of the universal Chul-ch, we
honoured with great reverence of holiness as well the
Britons as the Scots3 but having experience of the
Britons we thought the Scots better. Marry now,
we have learnt by bishop Dagan ² coming to this
before-mentioned island, and by the coming of
Columban‚³ abbot in France, that the Scots do nothing
differ from the Britons in their conversation. For
bishop Dagan coming to us would not only not eat
with us, but not so much as take his meat in the same
house where we were eating.'’ ⁴¹ The same Laur-
ence with his fellow bishops sent also letters meet
for his degree to the priests of the Britons wherein
he endeavoured to strengthen them in catholic

bishops against the invaders. The Celts were prone to
imprecationis.
