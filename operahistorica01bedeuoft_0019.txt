INTRODUCTION

Bmwssm the years 635 and 804 a succession of
three great scholars, whose fame extended far
beyond their native land, adorned the Church in
England, Aldhelm, Bede and Alcuin. Aldhelm be-
longed to VVesseX, Bede and Alcuin to Northumbria.
Aldhelm was abbot of Malmesbury and bishop of
Sherbome, Alcuin was master of the school of York,
and later passed into the service of Charlemagne.

Bede, says Fuller,l was “ the profoundest scholar
of his age for Latin, Greek, philosophy, history,
divinity, mathematickS, musick and what not '’?
The simple facts of his life, as well as a list of his
various writings, are given in his own words at the
end of the Ecclesiastical History.² He was born in
672 or 673 upon lands which shortly afterwards were
granted to Benedict Biscop ³ for the foundation of
WVearmouth Abbey. At the age of seven he was
“ given by the care of his kinsfolk to abbot Benedict-
to be brought up,’' and the rest of his life was spent
in the monastery, first at VVearmouth and then, a
year after he had been received, at Jarrow, where
he had been taken by Ceolfrid, its first abbot. He
was no doubt educated in the monastery school,
but of the brethren who taught him he only names
