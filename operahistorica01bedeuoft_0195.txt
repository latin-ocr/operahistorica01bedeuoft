mind, if there shall follow no delight in sin, there is
no 5111 at all committed: but when the flesh begin-
neth to take delight therein, then sin beginneth
to spring: if, moreover, advisedly he doth also
agree thereunto, then sin is found to be perfeeted.

‘⁶ So then in suggestion is the beginning, in delight
comes the feeding, in consent the finishing of sin.
And it oft chanceth that the evil that the wicked
spirit soweth in the thought, the flesh draweth unto
delight‚ and yet the soul doth not agree to the same
delight. And though the fiesh can feel no delight
without the mind, yet the mind himself striving
against the pleasures of the flesh is in a measure
against his will bound in the pleasure of the flesh, in
such sort that with reason he (loth gainsay it, lest he
should agree unto it3 and yet is bound with delight,
but so that he much lamenteth his band. Where—
upon that principa] champion of the heavenly army,
Saint Paul, bewaileth himself, saying) ‘ Ι 566 another
law in my members, warring against the law of my
mind, and bringing me into eaptivity to the law of
sin which is in my members.’ Now if he was in
captivity, least of all did he fight3 but yet too he did
fight: wherefore he was both in captivity and there—
fore strove with the law of his mind, against the
which the law, which is in our memberS, did fight.
But if he fought, he was not in captivity. Lo!
then man, that Ι may so speak, is in captivity and
free3 free through righteousness which he loveth,
in captivity through delight which he beareth against
his will.’'
