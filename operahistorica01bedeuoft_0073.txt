SEVERUS’ DYKE

granted him, whereby the Britons receiving then
the saith kept it sound, and undefiled in rest and
peace until Diocletian the emperor's time.

CHAPTER V

Hom Severus by a dyke drawn overthwart set-cred that
part of Britain which lae had recovered from the other.
193—211.

THE 189t111 year of the incarnation of our Lord
Severus, born in Africa at the town of Leptis in the
district of Tripolis, the 17th emperor after Augustus,
reigned 17 years. This man being rough of nature,
at all times tried with much wars, governed the
commonwealth very valiantly but with much travail.
After then he had vanquished his civil enemies with
which he was very sore assailed‚ he is drawn into the
provinces of Britain by the falling away of nigh all
the allies, where, after fighting many great and
grievous battles, he thought fit to have a partition
made betwixt the part of the island he had recovered
and the other wild and savage people, not with
building a wall of stone (as some suppose) but with
a dyke or rampart.2 For a wall is built with stones,
but a rampart, whereby a camp is fenced to ward off
the force of enemies, is made with turfs, wherewith,
when they are cut about, as it were a wall is raised
out of the earth high above the earth, so that in
front there be the trench whence the turfs were
lifted, and above it be sticked stakes of the stoutest
timber. And in such manner Severus caused a

Tyne to Hadrian. What Severus did must be regarded as
uncertain. There is an carthwork immediately behind the
wall of Hadrian, but its origin and object are disputed.
