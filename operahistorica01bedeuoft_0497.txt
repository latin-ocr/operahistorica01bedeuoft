BISHOPS OF MERCIA

provinces he brought over to the grace of the Christian
saith, when their unbelieving head was once cut off.

Now the first bishop made in the province of the
Marchmen, as well as of the Lindisfaras and of the
Middle Enghshmen, was (as we said before) Diuma
who died and was buried in the country of the Middle
Englishmen: the second was Ceollach, who, leaving
the charge of his bishopric yet living, returned to
Scotland. Both these were Scottish born. The third
bishop was Trumhere, of English birth but fully
instructed and ordained of the Scots, who was abbot
of the monastery which is named Ingetlingum.
This is the very place where king Oswin was slain,
as we have before recorded. For queen Eanfled,
being alliant to him,l required of king Oswy in part
of satisfaction of Oswin's unjust murder, that he
would grant there a place for the erecting of a
monastery for the use of the aforesaid servant of
God, Trumhere, because he was himself also of kin
to the slain king ε to the intent that in that monastery
continual prayers might be had for the eternal salva-
tion of both kings, that is to say, as well of the slain
as of him who commanded to slay. Now the same
king Oswy had authority 2 by the space of three years
after the death of king Penda over the people of the
Marchmen as well as over the other countries of the
southern provinces: subduing also the nation of
the Redshanks for the most part to the allegiance of
the English.

At which time he granted to the aforenamed
Peada‚ son of king Penda, because he was his
brother-in-law, the kingdom of the South March-
men, containing, as men say, 5000 households and
divided by the river Trent from the North Marchmen.
