INTRODUCTION

Bede’s Ecclesiastical History was translated into
Old English by Alfred the Great. The first rendering
into modern English was that which has been adapted
for the present edition, the work ofThomas Stapleton,
who was born in 1535 and died in 1598. Stapleton
was a scholar of winchester, a fellow of New College
and became prebendary of Chichester. Shortly
after Elizabeth’s accession, as he was one of those
who adhered to the unreformcd Church, he with-
drew to Louvain, and in 1563 lost his prebend.
But he and his friends did not give up the hope of
winning the queen to their side, and his object in
making his translation of Bede, which was published
at Antw erp in 1565, is cleaily stated ln his dedication.

“In this history it shall appear in what saith your
noble Realm was Christened, and hath almost these
thousand years continued, to the Glory of God, the
enriching of the Crown, and great wealth and quiet
of this realm. In this history your highness shall
see in how many and weighty points the pretended
reformers of the Church have departed from that
sound and catholick faith planted first among
Englishmen by holy St. Augustine, our apostle,
and his virtuous company, described truly and
sincerely by Venerable Bede, so called in all Christen-
dom for his passing virtues and rare learning, the
author of this history.'' But the ‘¹ cockle boat of
schismatica] noisomeness,” in which Elizabeth was
cmbarkcd, was steered fax-ther and farther away from
⁸⁶ the steadfast ark of Noah, '’ and Stapleton and his
friends w ere doomed to disappointment. He became
professor at Louvain and at Douay, was highly
esteemed as an able controversialist‚ and is deselibed
by Wood‚ the Oxford antiquary, as the most learned

Roman Catholic of all his time. ..
