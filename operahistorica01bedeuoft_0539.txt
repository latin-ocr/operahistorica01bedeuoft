POPE'S LETTER

under the protection of the Lord’s right hand you
are now converted to the true apostolic saith.
Blessed therefore is the people which hath been
found worthy to have 3 prince of such wisdom and
desire of God’s honour: as the which not only is
found, to honour God himself, but also studieth day
and night for the conversion of all his subjects to the
catholic and apostolic faith, purchasing thereby the
salvation of his own soul. For who hearing this
pleasant report would not rejoice thereat? Who
would not leap for joy at these godly works? Foras-

given thee for 3 light to the Gentiles thatthou mayest
be my salvation unto the end of the earth.’ And
again: ⁶ Kings shall see and princes shall arise and

thee for a covenant of the people that thou shouldest
raise up the earth and possess the scattered inheri-

that are in darkness, Shew yourselves.' And again:
⁴ I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and
have taken thine hand and kept thee3 and I have set
thee for 3 covenant of the people‚ for 3 light of the
Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind and to bring
out the prisoner from the prison and thern that sit in
darkness out of the prison house.’ Behold‚ most
