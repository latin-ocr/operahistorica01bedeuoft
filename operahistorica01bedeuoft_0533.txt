'WILFRID AND CHAD

measure: to wit, milk which the day before he was
wont to set fresh in a vial and when night was past,
skimming away the cream, he would drink what was
left along with a small portion of bread, as we have
said. And this kind of abstinence he was careful to
observe 40 days before Christmas, as also for as many
days after the festival of Pentecost was over, that' is,
50 days after Easter.

CHAPTER XXVIII

How after the death of Tuda, Wilfrid in Frauce, Chad
among the West Saxons were ordained bishops of
the province of Northumbria [665]

IN the meantime king Alchfrid sent the priest
Wilfrid unto the king of France 1 to have him
consecrated for himself and his household. Where-
upon the king of France sent him unto Agilbert to
be ordained, of whom we have made mention before,
and who having left Britain was made bishop of the
city of Paris3 and of him Wilfrid was consecrated
with great honour, a number of bishops meeting
together in a manor of the king's which is called
Compiegne. And Wilfrid making yet some abode
in parts beyond the seas by reason of his ordination,
king Oswy following the example of his son’s forward-
ness sent into Kent a holy man, of vir tuous behaviour,
sufficiently learned in reading of Scriptunes, and a
diligent per-‘fmmer ln deed οἳὃ that he had learned in
the Scriptures should be done, to be ordained bishop
of the church of York. Now this man was a priest
named Chad, brother to the most reverend bishop
Cedd of whom we have often made mention, and
abbot of the monastery which is called Lastingham.
