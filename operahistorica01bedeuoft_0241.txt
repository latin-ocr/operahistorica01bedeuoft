GREGORY ’S EPITAPH

Amongs’c his other doings the blessed pope
Gregory caused that in the churches of the holy
apostles Peter and Paul masses should be said over
their bodies. Moreover too in the very celebration
of these masses he added three petitions full of 'che
highest perfection: “And dispose our days in thy
peace, and command us to be taken from etei-nal
damnation, and 'co be numbered in the floek of thine
elect.''

Now he governed the Church in the days of the
emperors Maurice and Foeas. But in ’che second
year of the said Focas' empire, departing out of this
life he passed to the true life which is in heaven.
His body was buricd in deed in the church of the
blessed apostle Peter before 'che vestry, the 12th day
of March, with the which same body he shall rise
again hereafter 1n glory with the other pastors of the
holy Church: and 011 the tomb which he had for
hQself w as written 611Ἶ1 an epitaph as folloueth:

Ῥ6601ν,6 O 661 bh, this body formed of dus& of thino, to keep
Until the 661116 the Lord shall wako to life again from sleep.
His spirit, to the stars is gone, no right hath Death tso maim,
Which rather is the way for him that other life to claim.
Pontiff supreme, within the tomb his bones aro buried here,
Which ever and in every place made his good deeds appear.
The hungry he with iood sustained‚ the naketl he arra od,
With sacred warnings human 60016 from Satan’s power 16 stayed
He did m deed what thing 6 in word soever 116 did mach,
To be ensample unto them which heard his holy speech.

The EQ, {ish to Christ s saith he turned, his goodness being guide, 2,

And with εἰ now race [1161161116 ranl s of Christian men more wide·
This wasthy toil, thy zealous care, good shepherd, only fain
Unto thy Lord for osfering a larger flock to gain.

u ith these thy briumphs then rejoic e, God 6 consul captain made,
For of thy deeds a sure 1611 ard thou 11661, which cannot fade.”
