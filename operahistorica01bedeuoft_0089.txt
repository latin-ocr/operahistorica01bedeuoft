ARIAN HERESY

cometh forth and sheweth themselves abroad,
reneweth their churches which before were thrown
flat to the ground, foundeth, buildeth and perfecteth
new temples in honour of the holy martyrs, and
everywhere as it were displayeth their ensigns in
sign of conquest, celebrateth holy days, doth conÎ‡
secrate the holy mysteries with pure mouth and
heart: and this peace continued in the churches of
Christ in Britain until the times of the Arian fury,
which, after infecting the whole world, corrupted
also with 1115 venemous errors this island, though
situate so far out of the compass of the world: and
when that thus the disease had once found as it
were an open vent to pass over the ocean, shortly
after all the pestilence of all manner of heresies
fiowed into this island, and they were there received
of the inhabitants, as being men delighting ever
to hear new things and steadfastly retaining nothing
assured.

About this timel died Constantius in Britain,
which in Diocletian's lifetime governed Gaul and
Spain, a man very mild and of much courtesy He
left Constantine, his son by Helen his 0011011111110,2
created emperor of the Gauls. Eut tropius writeth
further that Constantine, being created empeior
in Britain, succeeded his father in the kingdom:
in whose time the heresy of the Arians, springing
and being discovered and condemned in the council
of Nicaea, did none the less infect not only all the
other parts of the world but also the churches of
these islands with the deathly venom of his infidelity.
