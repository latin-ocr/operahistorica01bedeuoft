BRITAIN

Saint Basil writeth 1), running through certain
metals, receiveth thereos such virtue of heat, that
it is not only made warm thereby but also scalding
hot. This island also is stored with mines of sundry
metals, as of copper‚ iron, lead and silver3 it bringeth
forth too, great plenty of the jet stone and that of
the best, and this stone is glossy black and burneth
being put to the fire, and then is of virtue good to
chase away serpents. If you rub him till he be warm
he holdeth fast such things as are laid unto him,
even as amber doth. This island too had in it
sometime 28 fair eities,2 besides an innumerable sort
of eastles which same also were well and strongly
fenced with walls, turrets, gates and bulwarks.³

And forasmuch as it is placed right in manner
under the North Pole of the heavens, it bath light
nights in the summer, so that at midnight many times
men looking doubteth whether it be yet of the even-
ing past or break of the day following, since the
sun at night dwelleth not long beneath the earth
but returneth shortly to the east through the
northern regions: whereby too the days be of a
great length there in summer, as contrary the nights
in winter, that is to wit 18 hours, by reason for sure
the sun then goeth away to the regions of Libya:
and so in like manner the nights in summer are there
very short, and the days in the winter, that is to xw't
six equinoctia14 hours only: whereas in Armenia,
Macedonia, Italy and the other countries subject to
the same line,5 the longest day or night passeth not
15, the shortest 9 hours in all.

⁶ Parallel of latitude. Eratosthenes of Cyrene, b. 276 13.o.,
first drew lines parallel with the equator.
