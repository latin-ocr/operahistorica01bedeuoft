in turn) make manifest our mutual unity of love. For
which benefit we render thanks unceasingly unto
His majest-y, and beseech Him with prayers of sup-
plication that He may strengthen your love to endure
steadfastly in labouring and gathering fruit in the
preaching of the Gospel‚ and in following the rule of
your head and master, holy Gregory, and that He
may raise greater increase by you unto the growth
of the Church3 that the gain which you and your
predecessors have won (which springeth out of the
first planting of our lord Gregory) may more abund-
antly be spread by becoming strong through faith and
work in the fear of God and in charity ; that the very
promises uttered by our Lord may hereafter have
regard unto you and that that voice of His may call
you forth to eterna] joyfulness 1: ‘ Come unto me all
ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will refresh
you.’ And again 2: ‘Well done, good and faithful
servant3 because thou hast been faithful over a few
things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord ἔ ’ And we for our part,
belovedbrethren‚sendforward these words of exhorta-
tion to you in behalf of the eternal charity, and defer
not to grant you the things which again we see are
able to be meet for the privileges of your churches.
And as in accordance with your request, so in
accordance with that of the kings 3 our sons, by our
express commandment in the stead of the blessed
Peter, chief of the apostles, we grant you authority,
that when the Divine Grace hath bidden one of you
to be called to Itself, he who shall be left alive must
ordain a bishop to be' successor in place of the departed
one. For which thing's sake also we have sent a
pall to each of you, beloved‚ to be used for celebrating
