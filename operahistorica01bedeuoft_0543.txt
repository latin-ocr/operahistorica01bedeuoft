we understanding and along with us the whole
apostolic see as far rejoice as her godly works do
smell sweet and blossom in the sight of God. We
beseech therefore your highness, according to our
wish, to hasten to dedicate all your island to God
Christ. For assuredly you lack not herein a pro-

heaping up the number of the new people of Christ,
and establishing there the catholic apostolic faith.
For it is written3: ‘ Seek ye first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you.’ For undoubtedly your highness
seeketh and hath obtained, and all your islands (as
we wish) shall be set under you. And so we salute
your excellency with fatherly affection, beseeching
continually the mercy of God that it vouchsafe to
assist you and yours in all good works, that in the
world to come ye may reign with Christ. May the
grace from above have your excellency in its safe
