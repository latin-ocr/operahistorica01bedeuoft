QUESTIONS

of them that are married, that the women think
scorn to nurse the sons born of their own body and
commit them to the charge of other women to
nurse, which thing surely seemeth to have been
found out only of incontinence: for therefore they
refuse to give suck to their own children, because
they will not forbear the company of their husbands.
Wherefore such as of an evil custom do put out
their children to nurse, shall not lie with their
husband until the day of their purification be fully
complete: seeing that also without excuse of child-
birth they are forbid to keep company with their
husbands in the time of their flowers3 so that the
holy Lawl doth punish with death them which
hath to do with a woman in that case. Which
woman yet is not to be forbidden to come to church
whilst she suffereth the monthly custom3 because
the superfluity of nature cannot be imputed to her
for sin: and for that she suffereth that against her
will, it is no reason she should be restrained from
coming into the church. For we know that the
woman which was diseased With the bloody flux,
coming humbly behind our Lord touched the hem
of His garment, and thereby forthwith her malady
departed. If then the woman which had the bloody
flux might laudably touch the garment of the Lord‚
why may not she enter into the church, that suffereth
her monthly flowers? But you say: ‘As for her,
her malady forced her to seek remedy3 but she
of whom we speak is taken of her customable weak-
neSS.’ Consider‚ however, this with thyseff, my
dear brother, that all that we suffer in this mortal
flesh by feebleness of nature, it was by the just
judgment of God ordained after fault committed3
