OSWY’S JUDGMENT

one corner of the uttermost island of the earth to
be put above the universal Church of Christ dis-
persed throughout the world?l And if hc. your
father Columba (yea, and our father if hc was
Christ's) was holy and mighty in works, can he by
any means be chosen above the most blessed chief
of the apostles, to whom our Lord said: 2 “Thou
art Peter, and upon this rock Ι will build my church,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and
I will give unto thee the, keys of the kingdom of
heaven '’ ἲ

ΨΙῑοη wilfrid thus concluded thc king said:
‘⁵ VVere these things, Colman, indeed spoken to that
Peter of our Lord? '’ And the bishop said: ‘⁶ They
were indeed, my lord king.’' Whereat the king
saith: ‘⁶ Can you bring forward any so special
authority given your Columba? ” thereon the
bishop said: ‘⁶ N0.'‘ Again the king said: ‘⁴ Whether
do ye both agree in this without any question, that
these words were principally spoken unto Peter, and
that unto him the keys of the kingdom of heaven were
given of the Lord? '’ They answered: “Yea, cer-
tainly.” Whereon the king thus concluded and
said: “ And I say unto you that I will not gainsay
such a porter as this is ; but as Ι know and have power,
I covet in all points to obey his ordinances, lest it
may be, when I come to the doors of the kingdom of
heaven, Ι find none to open unto me, having his
displeasure who is proved to hold the keys thereof.”

When the king so spake‚ all that sat or stood by,
the greater along with them of mean degree, gave
their consent thereto; and abandoning their former
imperfect usage hastened to change over to those
things which they had learned to be better.
