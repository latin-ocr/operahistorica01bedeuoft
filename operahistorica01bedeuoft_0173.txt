execution of discipline, your brotherhood must move
him and prick him forward thereunto. To whom also
we have written that, joyning m‘th your holiness
being there present, he will also himself with all
readiness of mind help to restrain from the manners
of the bishops all such ways as are contrary to the
command of our Creator. But you yourself out-
side your own authority shall not be able to give
judgment upon the bishops of France3 but by
persuading, by courteously entreating‚ by giving
example also of good works for them to follow,
reform to the pursuits of holiness the minds of the
evil disposed: for why? it is written in the Law:
‘ He that passeth through another man’s field shall
not thrust his sickle in the corn, but rub the ears
with his hand and so eat them.’ For thou canst
not thrust the sickle of thy judgment into the corn
that seemeth to have been committed to the other
man's charge3 but with the love of thy well-doing
rub off from the Lord’s corn the chaff of the sins
found therein, and by treating and persuading with
them convert them in the body of the Church as a
man doth the meat he eateth in his own body.
But whatsoever there is to be done by authority,
let it be done along with the aforesaid bishop of
Arles, lest that order should be neglected which was
devised by the ancient institution of our forefathers.
But as for all the bishops of the Britains,l we com-
mit them unto the charge of your brotherhood, that
the unlearned may be instructed, the weak by good
persuasions be strengthened, the froward be corrected
by authority.”
