SIGBERT AND CEDD

who murdered him had lived in unlawful wedlock,
and when the bishop was not able to let or amend it,
.he excommunicated him and commanded all that
should be ready to hear him, not to enter that
offender’s house or partake of his meat. But the
king set at nought the sentence of the bishop, and
when invited by the retainer, entered his house >to
feast there: and after departing therefrom he met
with the bishop. Thereon the king looking upon
him, by and by being much afeared, lighted off from
1115 horse and fell down before the bishop’s feet,
asking pardon for his offence. For the bishop too
lighted off his horse at the same time as the king:
for he was himself too on horseback. But in anger
he touched the king, as he lay on the ground, with
the rod he held in his hand and protested unto him
with bishoply authority, saying: “ I tell thee,
because thou wouldest not refrain from the house
of that wicked and damnable person, thou hast to
die in that very house.” Yet it is to be thought that
such a death of a devout man not only did wipe away
such a fault but also increased his merit: because he
came to his death for his goodness’ sake, for observing
the commandments of Christ.

Now there succeeded Sigbert in the kingdom,
Swidhelm‚ son to Sexbald, who was baptized by the
selfsame Cedd in the province of the East Englishmen
in a town of the king's called Rendlesham,l that is
to say, Bendil’s Steading3 and Ethelwald king of
the selfsame nation of the East English, brother to
Anna, former king of the same, lifted him up as he
was rising from the sacred font.2
