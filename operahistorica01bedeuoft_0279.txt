MELLITUS ARCHBISHOP

CHAPTER VII

How bislzop Mellitus quenched with his prayer the
flames burning Izi-sÎ‡ city.

Fon in the reign of this king Eadbald the blessed
archbishop Laurence ascended to the heavenly

to the see of Canterbury church, third archbishop
after Augustine: whenas Justus was still alive and
governed the church of Rochester. Which two
prelates, since they did rule the English Church with

apostolic sec, who after Deusdedit governed the
Church in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 619.

from fault of negligence taken with fire and began
to consume away by much increasing of the
flames, so that no man by any casting of water
was able to stay it, the greatest part of the city
