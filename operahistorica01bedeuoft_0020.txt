INTRODUCTION

Trumbert.l “ He was no gadder about ” : we have
traces of visits to Lindisfarne and York, but in all
probability he rarely went outside the bounds of
the monastery. As he says, “ I wholly applied
myself to the study of Scripture, and amid the
observance of monastic discipline, and the daily
care of singing in the church‚ I always took delight
in learning, teaching and writing,'' and so he might
be spared the labours of the plough, the winnowing
fan, the bakehouse‚ garden, kitchen and other work
which fell to the lot of his less scholar-ly brethren,2
according to the Benedictine rule. The monastery
of Wearmouth was founded in the year 674, and that
of Jarrow in 681 or 682, but, though at some distance
apart, the two formed a single monastery. Of the
abbots who ruled the two divisions of the monastery,
jointly or separately, in Bede’s lffetime, he has given
an account in his Lives of the Abbots‚ and from this
work we gain a picture of monastic life according to
Bede's own ideal.

In his own monastery Bede had the advantage of a
good library: he speaks with enthusiasm of the
books which Benedict Biscop brought back from his
visits to Rome, and this collection was doubled by
the care of abbot Ceolfrid.3 Books could also be
bon-owed by one monastery from another. Bede
knew Latin, Greek and probably some Hebrew.
The learning of Western Europe in his day was
summed up in his various works, and so made
available for his countrymen. The bulk of his
writings are theologicaL taking the form mainly of
commentarios which are largely based upon the
