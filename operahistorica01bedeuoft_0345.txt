LETTER OF HONORIUS

son, as it is meet for a loving father to do, that ye
hasten all manner of ways ye can with earnest will
and constant supplications to keep this that the
mercy of God hath vouchsafed to grant in calling
you to His grace3 that so He which hath vouchsafed
to bring you in this present world, freed from all
error, to the acknowledgment of His name, may
also prepare a mansion place for you in the heavenly
country. Be ye therefore often busied in the reading
of Gregory your preacher and my lord of apostolic
ῗὲθῖοἷῖ ἰήῖἶὴἒὲῒιῗέἷέἳέἕὲἓΐ ἓξῗέὴ Ἓξ ἧὲἓῗψίῃᾶοΐ
ῒίεἰά θΐοῗ· ῒΙιΞ· sake of your so'uls: that εξ hisypgygr
may both increase your kingdom and your people,
and make you to appear in the end without fault
before Almighty God. Now as concerning those
things which you hoped should be ordained by us
for your bishops‚ we do without any delay and with
readiness of mind make it our care to grant them, for
the sake of the unfeignedness of your saith, of which
we have been commendably informed in divers
reports by the hearers of these our presents3 and
we have sent two palls belonging to the two metro-
politam, that is, for Honorius and Paulinus, in order
that when one of them is called out of this world to
the Author of his being, the other should appoint a
bishop in his place by this our authority. And this
thing truly we are moved to grant, as well for the
good will of your love, as for the situation of such
great provinces at the distance which is known to
separate us from you, to the intent we might in all
points shew our readiness to meet your devotion and
act according to your wishes.

“ May the grace from above have your excellency
in safe keeping Ξ ”
