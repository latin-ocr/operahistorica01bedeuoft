SYNOD OF WHITBY

Law but rather fulfil it, for in the Law it is eom-
manded that the Passover should be solemnized from
the evening of the 14th day of the change of the
moon of the first month until the one-and-twentieth
day of the same moon at evening: to the following of
which observation all the successors of blessed John
in Asia after his death and all the Church throughout
the world were converted. And it was by the Nicene
Council not newly decreed but confirmed (as thc
ecclesiastical history witnesseth)‚ that this is the
true Easter, this only is to be celebrated by believing
men. Whereby it is clear, my lord Colman, that

you neither follow the example of John (as you ’

suppose), neither os Peter, whose tradition you wit-
tingly withstand, nor do you agree with the Law
nor the Gospel in the observation of your Easter.
For John observing the Paschal time according to
the decrees of the Mosaic law had no regard to the
first day after the Sabbath3 and this you do not
follow, who keep Easter only on the first day after
the Sabbath. Peter celebrated the Lord’s Easter
day from the 15th day of the chanp'e of the moon
until the one-and-twentieth day3 which you follow
not, which keep the Lord's Easter day from the
14th day of the moon until the 20th: so that often-
times you begin Easter in the 13th day of the change
of moon at evening‚ of which neither hath the Law
made any mention, neither did the Lord, the maker
and giver of the Gospel, on that day, but on the
l4th, eat either the old Passover in the evening,
or hand down the sacraments of the New Testament
to be celebrated of the Church in commemoration
of His passion. Likewise the one-and-twentieth day
of the moon, which the Law expressly commanded
