INTRODUCTION

writings of the four great Latin fathers, Augustine‚
Jeron1e,Ambrose and (i1weg‚0ry though these by no
means cover the full extent of his reading. Of the
ancient classical authms we find echoes of Vergil and
less frequently of Ovid and Hor Uice but these he
may have found quoted in other works, for Bede
would not have thought time profitably spent in
a prolong(d study Osa pagan writers.¹ Besides his
theolog wicil writings, Bede wiote upon orthography,
metre 0and figures of speech for the bencfit of his
scholars. He also wrote upon natural phenomena, a
work which surnrnarizcd the natural philosophy of
the Roman Empire‚ and chronological treatises on
Times and the counting of Times, His historical
works comprise the Ecclesiastical History, the History
os ille Abbots and the Letler to Bislzop Egbert, as well
as lives of St. Cuthbert in verse and prose.

In these volumes we are coneerned with Bede’s
historica] writings. Critics are agreed in praising
his learning and industry‚ his love of simplicity and
truth. In all that he relates he is careful to give
his authority. “I would not that my children
should read a lie‚” was one of his last utterances.
He quotes documents, if they are available‚ and
whether for ordinary or extraordinary events he
gives, where he can, first-hand evidence, and if that
is not forthcoming, or if he has nothing to rely upon
save common report, he frankly says so. It is
noticeable that of the many marvels which Bede
records he does not give one on his own knowledge,
and his lives of the first five abbots of his own
monastery contain no notice of a single miracle
