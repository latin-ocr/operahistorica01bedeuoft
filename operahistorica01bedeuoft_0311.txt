LE'ITER OF BONIFACE

his understanding by thy often encouragements‚
that so it may truly appear to be fulfilled assuredly
in thee, which is testificd in holy Scripture ε ¹ ‘ The
unbelieving husband shall be saved by the woman
that believcth.' For unto this end thou hast gained
the pitifulness of the Lord’s goodness, that thou
shouldest render back to thy Redeemer the multiplied
fruit of thy saith and the good gifts committed unto
thee. And verily that thou mayest have strength
to fulfil this work by the help of the protection of
His lovingkindness, we cease not to ask with con—
tinual prayer.

“ In these words therefore sent in advance, shewing·
you the duty of our fatherly love, we exhort you
that having found the opportunity of a bearer yc
will as quickly as possible by favourable tidings give
us comfort concerning those things which the power
from above shall vouchsafe to work marvellously by
you in the conversion of your husband and your
subjects, that we (which carefully and longingly
look for the happy news of the salvation of the
soul of you and all yours) by this your tidings may
be comforted, and acknowledging the brightness of
the divine graciousness more richly spread abroad
in your midst. we may with joyful confession give
deservedly abundant thanks to God the giver of all
good things and the blessed Peter, the chief of the
a ostles.

p“ Furthermore, we have sent you the blessing of
your protector the blessed Peter, chief of the apostleS,
that is to say by a looking-glass of silver and a comb
of ivory gilt with gold3 and we pray your highness
to accept this gift in that spirit of lovingkindness in
the which, as ye understand, it hath been sent by us.”
