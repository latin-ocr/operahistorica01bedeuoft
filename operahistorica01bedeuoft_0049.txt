PREFACE

Gregory ¹ as well as of other bishops there, and at
his return hath delivered unto us the said epistles
to be put into our History with the counsel and advice
of the most reverend father Albinus above mentioned.
So that from the beginning of this book unto the
time that the English nation received the saith of
Christ we learned such things as to publish‚ the same
being gathered from divers quarters out of the works
chiefly of such as had wrote thereof before our time.
And from thence unto this present, such things as
hath been done in the church of Canterbury by the
disciples of the blessed pope Gregory or their suc-
cessors, or under what kings they have been done, we
have known by the industry of the said abbot Albinus
by the hand, as we have said, of Nothelm. Who
also have brought me in some part of knowledge of
such things as were done in the provinces of the
East and XVest Saxons, and also of the East English
and of the Northumbrians3 that is, to wit, by what
bishop's preaching and under what king each of the
said provinces received the grace of the Gospel.
And, to be short, by the exhortation of the said
Albinus Ι was chiefly provoked and ernboldened to
set upon this enterprise. Moreover, Daniel2 also
the most reverend bishop of the West Saxons (which
is yet alive), hath instructed me by writing in certain
points of the ecclesiastical history of his province,
and at the same time of the next adjoining province
of the South Saxons and also of the Isle of Wight.
Now in what sort either the province of Mercia
attained to the saith which they knew not before,
or the province of the East Saxons recovered the
saith which they had rejected before (both by the
ministry of Cedd and Chad,³ devout priests of Christ),
