SYNOD OF WHITBY

for celebration, you do utterly exclude from the
celebrating of your Easter: and thus, as Ι said, in

successors‚ men beloved of God, who after the same
manner kept their Easter, thought or acted contrary
to the divine pages? Seeing there were very many
among them, to whose holiness witness was borne by
heavenly signs and miracles of mighty works wrought
by thern: and as I doubt not but they were holy

ignorant of or if ye know it, yet though it be close
kept by the whole Church of Christ, ye set light by

that same day at evening to be the 15th of the change,
after the manner of the Egyptians. He also assigned
’she 20th day to the Lord’s Easter in such a way
