PREFACE

to be good and acceptable to God. Which very
thing you too, most warily pondering, (out of the
respect you have to the common good), desire to
have the said history more widely published, both
to the instruction of yourself and also to the edifying
of such other whom the authority of God hath com-
mitted unto your governance.

And to the intent I may put both you and all
other that shall hear or read the said History out
of all doubt of the verity in those things Ι have
written, I will be careful briefly to show you what
authors I have chiefly followed in the making there-
of. The chiefest author and aider I had in compiling
this small work was the most reverend abbot
Albinus,l a man instructed in all manner of know-
ledge3 which being brought up in the church of
Canterbury under archbishop Theodore,2 of blessed
memory, and abbot Hadrian, men of great worship
and learning, harh diligently procured and sent unto
me all such things as were done by the disciples of
the blessed pope Gregory in the province of Canter-
bury itself, either also in other places adjoining and
bordering upon the same: which things the said
abbot had learned partly by writings, partly also
by tradition of elders; and such of these things as
seemed deserving of record he hath sent unto me
by the hands of Nothelm,3 a devout priest of the
church of London, to be received either in writing,
either by mouth and relation of the said Nothelm.
Which same Nothelm going after unto Rome was
permitted by Greo gory ¹² the bishop which 1s now head
of the selfsame Church of pope Gregory ⁵ to search
the closets of the said holy Church of Rome, where
he found out certain epistles of the blessed pope
