INTRODUCTION

of their poetry) had filled up the chasma with
venerabilis.’' But the title was in those days a
common designation of priests, as the Ecclesiasticus
History often shows, and has been permanently
attached to Bede.

Bede has told us but little of himself. One story
of his youth comes from another source. When the
plague of 686 had swept away at Jarrow all those
who could recite the antiphons and responseS‚ except
the abbot and one little lad, it was deeided that
the services should be conducted in their regular
course by means of these two alone, and the boy can
hardly have been any other than Bede himself.
Of his last days we have an account in a letter
written by Cuthbert (afterwards abbot of NVear—
mouth) to his friend Cuthwin.l

Bede’s body was buried at JarrOW, but in the
eleventh century his bones were taken away by a
priest of Durham and put in St. Cuthbert's coffin,
where they were found at the translation of St.
Cuthbert in 1104 and placed in a casket of gold and
Silver in the galilee of Durham cathedral. In 1541
the casket was rifled and the remains of Bede
dispersed. A cross was ereetcd to his memory at
Roker Point near J arrow and unveiled in 1904.

Fuller concludes his account in these words: “nor
have Ι ought else to observe of Bede, save onely this;
a foreign embassador, some two hundred yeares
since, coming to Durham, addressed himself first to
the high and sumptuous shrine of St. Cuthbert, If
thou beest a saint, pray for me ε then coming to the
plain, low and little tombe of Bede, Because (said he)
thou art a saint, good Dede, prayfor me ''—a conclusion
which is finer than man)⁷ more laboured eulogieS.
