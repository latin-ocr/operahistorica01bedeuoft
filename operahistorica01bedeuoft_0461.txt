FURSA 'S VISION S

Why make a long story? In process of time he
both builded himself a monastery wherein he might
with more liberty attend to the study of heavenly
things: and therein being stricken with sickness he
was taken out of the body‚1 as the book written of
his life doth sufficiently testify: and from evening
until cockcrow being out of the body he was thought
worthy to behold the sight of the angelical company,
and to hear their blessed thanksgivings. Further,
he was wont to tell that among other things he openly
heard them sing: ‘⁴ Holy men shall go from virtue
to virtue.'' 2 And again: ‘⁴ The God of gods shall
be seen in Sion.’' And this man, being restored
again to the body and within three days after taken
out again, saw not only greater joys of the blessed‚
but also mighty conflicts of wicked spirits which
without rest went about to stop him of his journey
toward heaven with their often accusations, but yet
by the warding of the angels availed naught against
him: of all the which things if any listeth more at
large to be instructed, as with what spiteful subtleties
the evil spirits unfolded his doings and superfluous
words as well as his very thoughts, as if they had been
written in a book; what glad and heavy tidings he
learned of the holy angels, and what things of
righteous men appearing unto him amongst the
angels‚ let him read the little book itself of his life,
of which I have spoken, and he shall receive therefrom,
as I think, much spiritual advantage.

Among the which yet one thing there is that we
have thought profitable to many to set down in
this History. At what time then he was carried
away heavenward, he was commanded of the angels
who conducted him, to look back upon the world.
