PICTS AND SCOTS

of the inhabitants that they too might be suffered
there to rest and plant themselves. The Scots
nnswered that the island was not big enough to hold
them both: ‘⁴ but we can give you good counsel ”
(quoth they) “ what we think best for you to do.
We know well there is another island not far from
ours, standing eastwards from hence, which we may
often see from afar in a fair sunny day. If you will
go thither, you are strong enough to inhabit there at
will; or if there be any resistance made against you,
rely on us to aid you! ’³ Whereupon the Redshanks
making for Britain began to plant themselves
throughout the north parts of the island, for as for
the south parts the Britons had taken them up
before. And whereas the Redshanks having no wives
did require of the Scots to marry their daughters,
the Scots agreed to grant them their boon under eon-
dition only, that as often as the matter was in doubt,
they should choose their king rather of the female
than the male line of the royal house; which order
it is well known the Redshanks keepeth to this day.1
Now in process of years, after the Britons and the
RedshankS, the Scottish folk beside the other two
were received into Britain in the portion held by the
Redshanks ; which coming out of Ireland under Reuda
their captain, either by friendship or the sword, chose
for themselves amongst the Redshanks the country
which they inhabit even now : ² and from their
captain even unto this day they are called Dal-
reudings‚3 for in their language daal signifieth part.
Now Ireland both in extent of its breadth‚4 whole—
someness and fineness of air, far passeth Britain, so
that there snow remaineth scant three days together:
no man there for stress of winter either cutteth hay
