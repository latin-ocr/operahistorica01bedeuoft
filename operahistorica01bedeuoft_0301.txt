LETTER OF BONIFAOE

Wherefore we have thought it good to exhort >our
highness in this our present letter with all affection
of inward 0113111)- ; to the intent that loathing idols
and thei1 11 orship, and despising the fond foolishness
of their temples and the deceitful enticements of
soothsaying‚ ye may now believe 1n God the Father

by the hands of thy inferiors and subjects3 upon
which, namely, by employment of the work of crafts-
men thou hast bestowed the likeness of limbs without
life; which, were they not moved by thee, shall not
be able to walk, but like a stone set fast in one
place, so are they builded up, and having no under-
standing and stark with right insensibleness have

cannot by any discretiori and judgment find out
