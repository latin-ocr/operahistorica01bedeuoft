ROMAN HELP

creek there is a city builded called Giudi 1; above
the west creek, that is to say, toward the right hand,
standeth a city called Alclyde,2 which in their
language is as much as to say as the rock Clyde3 for
it standeth by a flood of that name. ⁵

The Britons then being thus affiicted by the said
nations sent their ambassadors with letters unto
Rome with lamentable supplications,³ requiring of
them aid and succour, promising them their con-
tinual fealty, so that the enemy which threatened
them were kept to a farther distance. Whereupon
shortly there was sent unto them a legion of armed
soldiers, which coming to the island and encountering
with the enemies overthrew a great number of them,
and drave the rest out of the frontiers of their alljes:
and so, setting them meanwhile at liberty and free
from the misery with which they were before so
grievously overcharged, counselled them to build
a wall athwart the island between the two seas,
which might be of force to keep out their enemiesz
and that done they returned home with great
triumph. But the islanders, building the wall which
they were bid to make, not of stone, as they were
willed, but of turf, as having none among them that
had skill for so great an undertaking, raised it to be
of use for no purpose. And this wall they made
between the two great arms or creeks of the sea
(whereof we have already spoken), many miles long:
in such sort that, whereas the fence of the water
lacked‚ there by the help of the dyke they might
keep their boundaries free from the breaking in of
their enemies: of which piece of work, that is, of the
very broad and high dyke, there remaineth even
unto this day most assured tokens to be seen on the.
