J ULIUS CAESAR

CHAPTER ΙΙ

How that Gaius Julius was the first of the Roma-ns that
came into Britain. 55-54 13.C.

Now the Romans had never access unto the said
land of Britain nor knowledge thereof until Gaius
Julius Caesar came: who the 693rd year from the
building of Rome but the 60th before the time of the
incarnation ofthe Lord‚¹ after filling the office of consul
with Lucius Bibulus, at the time that he had battle
against the nations of Germany and Gaul (which two
countries only the river Rhine doth sever) came in
the land of the Morini, whence is a very nigh and
short passage into Britain, and with about 80 ships
charged with warfare provision‚ and swift sanem,
passed over into Britain; where he being first tried
with a very sharp and hot bickering, and after
shaken by a contrary tempest, was fain to return
into Gaul with the loss of 3 great part of his navy,
and no small number of his soldiers‚ and of the most
part of all his horsemen. And so for that season
he was forced to send his rnen into winter quarters,
and gave command for 600 ships of both services 2
to be built: with the which he sailed over again into
Britain in the early spring³z where after he had
arrived and was now marching towards his enemy
with his main host, his ships riding at the anchor
were with a violent storm rent and cast either one
upon the other, either upon the quicksands, and
there broken in pieces: in such sort that 40 of them
were lost out of hand, and the rest with much ado
repaired. Caesar’s horsemen at the first encounter
