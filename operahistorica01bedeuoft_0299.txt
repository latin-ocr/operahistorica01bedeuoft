LETTER OF BONIFACE

wit and the earth, the sea and all that in them is,
setting the degrees, in which they should abide, by
the counsel of His eternal Word, and ordering them
by the unity of the Holy Ghost‚ made man (fashioned
of the mire of the earth) to His own image and like-
ness, and gave him such pre-eminence of reward that
He set him above all things, and (so that he kept the
bounds of His commandment) fenced him with the
assurance of immortality. This God then, the
Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, which is
the inseparable Trinity, mankind, from the rising of
the sun even to the going down of the same, worship·
peth and adoreth with wholesome confession of faith
as the Creator of all things and their own Maker:
to the which God the supreme honours of empire and
the puissant powers of state are lowly subject,
because by His ordinance authority over all kingdoms
is granted. His merciful goodness therefore in
extending His aid to all His creation hath marvellously
vouchsafed to enkindle with the heat of the Holy
Ghost the cold hearts of the nations set even in the
uttermost parts of the earth in the aeknowledgment
also of Himself.

“For we reckon your highness hath come to a
fuller understanding than we (the country lying so
near), of what the mercy of the Redeemer hath
wrought in the illumining ofhis highness our son king
Audubald and the nations subject unto him. There-
fore do we trust with certain hope that by His
heavenly longsuffering the wonderful gift is being
bestowed also in you; seeing indeed we have learnt
the sovereign lady your wife (who is discerned to be
part of your body) to be illuminated with the reward
of eternity by the regeneration of holy baptism.
