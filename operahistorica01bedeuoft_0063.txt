IRELAND

in the summer or buildeth stalls for his cattle z there
is no noisome creeping beast to be seen there, no
serpent that can live there : for many times serpents
which hath been brought thither out of Britain, as
soon as (the ship drawing near unto the land) they
are touched with the smell of the air thereof, they
dieth out of hand: yea, more than that, all things
in manner that cometh from the said island is of
sovereign virtue against poison. And this we saw
with our own eyes, that when certain men that were
stinged of venomous serpents had taken the scraped
leaves of trec-stems 1 which had been of Ireland, and
the serapings of the same had been put in water and
given to the stinged men for drink, forthwith all the
force of the spreading venom was staunched and the
swelling of the inflamed body utterly assuaged. This
island is rich in milk and honey, nor void of vines,
fish or fowl; moreover, too, it is famed for hunting of
stags and wild-goats. And this is properly the
country of the Scots,2 out of which they issuing
added a third nation to the Britons and Redshanks
in Britain.

And there is a mighty creek of the sea3 which
severed of old times the nation of the Britons from
the Redshanks, which from the west runneth far into
the land, where unto this day there is a city of the
Britons, very strong and well fenced, called Alclyde 4:
at the north side of the which creek the Scots, as we
said, hath come and made their dwelling country.

¹ Might be leaves of a, book, but Pliny, NH. xxv. 6, speaks
of a herba Britannica aalutaris contra serpentes.

² In Bede's <la scottia meant Ireland.
³ Firth of Cly ο.
