lN'l'RODUCTION

The first critical edition of the text was that of
Smith, 1722. Stapleton used the Basle edition of
Bede’s collected works, 1563, and this accounts for
some errors in his translation. But apart from this
it must be admitted that he treats the Latin of his
author rather cavalierly. He paraphrases and
amplifies and omits, and it is not too much to say that
there is scarcely a sentence in which some alteration
is not required, if the English version is to be a close
rendering of Bede's Latin. But, notwithstanding
such drawbacks‚ Stapleton belonged to the age of
the Book of Common Prayer and the Authorised
Version of the Bible. The structure of his clauses
is nearer akin to the Latin than the more choppy
sentences of modern English: he has a dignity and
nobility of style and a constant happiness of phrase,
which have deservedly kept his translation alive.
And, apart from the intrinsic merits of his work, it
is probably better to read an author dealing with an
age like Bede's‚ so different from our own in its
thoughts and ways, through the medium of a trans-
lation which does not belong to our own day. It
gives an atmosphere in which we breathe more
naturally: we see, as it were, the ancient building
in a mellower and less garish light.
