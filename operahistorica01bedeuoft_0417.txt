MIRACLE IN A FIRE

been slain. Accordingly he stole away with him
some of the dust of that earth, knitting it up in a
linen eloth, deeming with himself, as indeed was to
come to pass, that the same dust might be profitable
for the remedy of sick persons; and continuing with
his journey he came in the evening to a certain village,
and entered into a house in which the villagers were
at feast supping3 and being received by the masters
of the house, sat down himself also at their enter-
tainment‚ hanging upon one of the posts of the wall
the linen cloth with the dust which he had brought.
And as they set themselves further to feasting and
drinking, a great fire being lighted in the midst‚ it
happened that, the sparks flying up alost, the roof of
the house, which was built of twigs and thatched,
was suddenly caught on fire and filled with flames.
And when the guests espied this with sudden distress
of panio, they fled out of doors, having no power to
save the house now on fire and on the point of being
consumed. The house, therefore, being destroyed
with the flames, only the post (whereon the dust
hanged, enclosed in the cloth) continued safe from
the fire and therewith not hurt at all. At the sight
of which mighty work they marvelled much, and
with diligent inquiry and examination found out that
the dust had been taken from ’that place where king
Oswald’s blood had been shed. And after that these
miracles had been manifestly known and bruited
abroad much people began, as the days passed, to
resort to that place and obtain there the grace of
cures for themselves and their kin.
