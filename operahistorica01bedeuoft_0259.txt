After this the beloved man of God, father Augus-
tine, died, and his body was laid by the church of othe
blessed apostles Peter and Paul (of which church
we have made mention before), without the dooi
thereos, because it was not yet finished nor dedicated.
But as soon as the church was dedicated, his body
was brought in and decently buried in the north
chapel of the church: where also were interred the
bodies of all the archbishops following, except two
only, that is Theodore and Bertwald, whose bodies
were laid in the church itself, because the said
chapel could receive no more. This chapel hath
almost in the middle of it an altar dedicated in the
honour of the blessed pope Gregory, at the which
altar every Saturday masses 1 in their memory are
solemnly celebrated by the priest of that place.
Moreover, in the tomb of the same Augustine was
written such an epitaph as followeth:

“Heme—Aleth-jQAEQt the lord ἶ Augustine,

first archbishop of Canterbury‚ who aforetime sent
hither of the bplessed Gregoiy, bishop of the city of
Rome, and strengthened of God by wolking of
miracles, won ov er Ethelbert the king and his people
from the worship of idols to the saith of Chrispt, and
so fulfilling' 1n peace the days of his office he djed the
26th of May ² in the reign of the same king.”

² Aqenda is a. mass for the dead.
² The year is uncertain.
