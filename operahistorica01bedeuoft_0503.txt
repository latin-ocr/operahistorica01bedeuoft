EASTER QUESTION

was borne in patience of all men, who had come to
know very well, that though he was not able to
celebrate Easter contrary to the custom of those who
had sent him, yet he set himself diligently to perform
works of saith, mercy, and love according to the
manner customable with all holy men: upon which
consideration he was deservedly beloved of all men,
even of those which varied from him about Easter :
and was held in reverence not only of the common
sort but also of the bishops themselves, Honorius
of the men of Kent and Felix of the East English.
But after the death of Finan which came after
Aidan, when Colman succeeded to the bishopric‚
who also himself was sent from Scotland, there
arose a sharper disputation about the observanee of
Easter as well as upon other rules of ecelesiastica]
life: by occasion whereof this inquiry rightly stirred
the minds and hearts of many from sear, lest, having
gained the name of Christians‚ they did run or had
run in vain.1 The dispute reached too to the ears of
the princes themselves, to wit of king Oswy and his
son Alchfrid3 of whom Oswy, being brought up and
baptized of the Scots and right skilful also in their
tongue, thought nothing better than the manner
which they had taught. In his turn Alchfrid, having
for his teacher in Christian instruction Wilfrid, a
man of great learning (for he had both travelled to
Rome on his first visit for the sake of ecclesiastica]
teaching and spent a long time at Lyons with
Dalfinus‚ archbishop of France‚ of whom also he
had taken the crown 2 of ecclesiastica] tonsure),
knew that Wilfrid‘s teaching was rightly to be chosen
rather than all the traditions of the Scots t wherefore
also he had granted him a monastery of 40 households
