AUGUSTINE'S MIRACLES

heavenly gift both thou joyest with sear and fearest
with joy. Thou hast to joy, namely‚ for that by
means of outward miracles the souls of the English
are won to inward grace: but thou hast to sear,
lest, in the midst of the miracles which be done,
thy weak heart be lifted up in exaltation of thyself,
falling as far inwardly by vainglory as thou art out-
wardly raised to honour. For we must remember
that the disciples returning with joy from their
preaching, when they said unto their heavenly
Masterzl ‘Lm-d, even the devils are subject unto
us through thy name3 ² forthwith heard the words:
‘ In this rejoice not, but rather rejoice, because your
names are written in heaven.’ For they had fastened
their mind upon a private and tempora] joy, when
they joyed of their miracles3 but they are called
back from private j0y unto common, and from
tempora} to eternaL to whom it is said: ‘In this
rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.’
For not all the chosen of God doth miracles; but
yet all their names are recorded in heaven. For
why? They which be the disciples of the truth
ought to joy in nothing, but only in that good thing
which they have in common with all, and whereof
they have joy without end. This therefore re-
maineth, dear beloved brother, that of the things
which by the power of God thou workest outwardly‚
thou exactly ever discuss with thyself inwardly‚
and accurately understand both thyself who thou
art, and what plenty of grace there is in that same
country for whose sake (to the intent it might be
the rather converted) thou hast received the gift
of working miracles. And if thou remember that
thou hast at any time either by word or deed offended
