CHAPTER XXXIV

Hom Ethelfritlz king qf' the Northwnbers did crusk the
tribes qf the Scots in battle and drave them from
the bomzdaries of the English,

ABOUT this time Ethelfrith, a man very valiant and
much desirous of renown, was king of Northumber-
land, one that more wasted the people of the Britons
than any of the princes of the English3 so that it
seemed he might be compared unto Saul, sometimes
king of the Israelite people‚ save only that he was
ignorant of God's religion. For none of all the
colonels} none of all the kings did conquer more of
the land of the Britons (either driving the natives
clean out of the country or subduing them, or
making them tributary or planting the Angles in
their places) than did this Ethelfrith. To whom
that might be well applied that the patriarch said 2
when he gave his son his blessing in the person of
Saul: “ Benjamin is a ravening wolf: in the morn-
ing he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall
divide the spoil.’'

VVhereby Aedan,3 king of the Scots which dwell
in Britain, much grudging to see him go forward
after this sort, assembled a main and a strong army
against him3 but m'th a few men he fled away
vanquished‚ seeing that in that famous place of
Degsastan‚⁴¹ that is Degsa’s stone, well-nigh all his
army was slain. In which field also Theodbald,
brother to Ethelfrith‚ was killed, with all that part of
the army whereof he was general. Which war
namely Ethelfrith brought to an end in the year
of the Lord's incarnation 603 and the llth year of
