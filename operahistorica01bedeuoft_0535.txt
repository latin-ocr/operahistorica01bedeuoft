CHAD'S ORDINATION

And the king sent with him his priest, Eadhed by
name, who after in the reign of king ngrid was made
prelate of the church of Ripon. But they at their
arrival in Kent found that the archbishop Deusdedit
had now passed from the world and no other was yet
appointed bishop in his room. Whereby they stroke
over to the province of the West Saxons where Wini
was bishop3 and of him the foresaid Chad was
consecrated bishop, having with him to assist and
accompany him at the ordination two bishops of the
British race, who celebrate the Lord’s Easter day, as
hath often been said before, contrary to 1 the canonical
order from the 14th to the 20th moon. For there
was not at this time, beside this bishop Wini, any
bishop canonically ordained in all Britain.2 Chad then
being consecrated bishop began shortly to be zealous
in care for ecclesiastical truth and purity of doctrine3
to apply his heart to lowliness, abstinency and study3
to visit continually the towns, country places‚cottages,
villages, houses for the sake of preaching the Gospel,
not making his journey on horsebaek but going on
foot as the apostles used. For he was one of Aidan ’s
scholars and laboured to instruct his hearers in the
same way of life and behaviour after the example of
Aidan and his own brother Cedd. Wilfrid also com-
ing to Britain, now made a bishop, did himself too
by his teaching bring into the churches of the English
very many rules of catholic observance. Whereby
it came to pass that the catholic practice daily
continuing to increase, the whole company of the
Scots which lived among the Englishmen either
yielded to the same or returned back to their country.

2There was Bonifa a,0e bishop of Dunwich‚ consecrated by
Honorius, cf. ΙΙΙ. 20.
