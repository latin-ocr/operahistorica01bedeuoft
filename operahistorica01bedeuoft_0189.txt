cannot contain, let him have his wife; ’1 he was

“ Moreover‚ it is to be pondered with good heed
that the Lord intending to speak to the people in
the mount of Sinai, first gave commandment that
the same people should abstaiu from women. And
if the purity of the body was there so earnestly
required, where the Lord by means of a creature
made subject to Him did speak unto men, that they
which should hear the words of God should be free
from women3 how much more the women which
receive the body of the Almighty Lord shall seek to
preserve in themselves the cleanness of the flesh,
lest they may take hurt by the very greatness of
that inestimable mystery. Hereof also it is said
by the priest³ unto David as touchiug his servants,
that, if they were clean from women, they should
eat of the Shew Bread‚ which otherwise they should
no way be suffered to take, except David would
first say that they were clean from women. Then,
moreover, the man who hath been washed with
water after the carnal knowledge of his wife may
also receive the mystery of the holy Communion,
when according to the judgment before laid down
he may come also to the church.''

IX. Question qf' Augustine. ‘⁴ &Vhether after the illu-
sion which is wont to befall unto a man in his dream,
either anyone may receive the body of the Lord or,
if he be priest, celebrate thc holy mysteries? ''
