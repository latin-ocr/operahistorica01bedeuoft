better be spread over all nations that be not yet
converted. Be therefore, my brother, zealous to
keep with pure sincerity of mind this authority
which thou hast gotten by the bounty of the see
apostolic, earnestly considering what it is that is
figured by the vestment of such exceeding honour,
which thou hast received to be worn upon thy
shoulders. And calling for the mercy of the Lord,
endeavour to prove thyself such a man as may shew
and present the rewards of the gift we have bestowed,
before the tribunal of the supreme J udge that is
to come, not with the loss but with the gain of souls.
God have thee in His safe keeping, most beloved
brother! ”

CHAPTER IX

Of the reign ρ]θ king Edu-ein, and hom Paulinus, coming
to preach the Gospel to him, first instructed his
daughter in the myster-ies of the Christian saith
and others with her.

Anou'r this time the people also of Northumber-
land (that is, that nation of the English which dwelt
toward the north side of the flood Humber)‚ received
together with their king Edwin the word of faith
by the preaching of Paulinus, of whom we have
spoken before.1 To the which king to wit in a good
abodement 2 of receiving the saith and the heavenly
kingdom was granted also greater power by the
increase of his earthly dominion: insomuch that he
brought under subjection all the coasts of Britain,
where either the provinces of the English themselves
or the Britons had their habitation, which thing
no one of the English kings had done before him.
