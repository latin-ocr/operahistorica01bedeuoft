CEDD AND LASTINGHAM

of good works should there spring, where before
either beasts or men beastly living had been used to
make their abode.

Now the man of the Lord, desiring first by prayer
and fasting to cleanse the place he had obtained for
the monastery from the former filth of iniquities
there committed, and so to set thereon the founda-
tions of the monastery, required of the king that he
would grant him opportunity and leave to abide in
that same place to pray all the time of the 40 days
of Lent that then approached. In all which days,
except the Lord's day, prolonging his fast until the
evening‚ as the manner is, not even then did he take
aught but a little bread and one hen's egg with a little
milk mingled with water. For, as he said, the custom
of them of whom he learned the trade of monastica]
life 1 was that, when places had been newly obtained
for making a monastery or a chureh, they should first
consecrate them to the Lord with prayer and fasting.
In this his fast, 10 days only remaining of the 40,
there came one to call him to the king. But, to 'ch-3
intent the godly work might not be interrupted by
occasion of the prince’s business, he entreated his
priest Cynibill, who was also his brother german,
to make an end of the good work begun. And when
his brother readily agreed thereto‚ applying himself
to fasting and prayers until they were fulfilled‚ Cedd
made there the monastery which is now called
Lastingham‚² giving it rules and orders of leligion
according to the practice of Lindisfarne where hee w as
brought up in.

Thus governing many a year both his bishopric' ln
