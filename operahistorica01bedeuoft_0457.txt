But he, remembering his profession, being set in
the midst of the goodly host would carry only a little
rod in his hand: and was slain along with king Egric,

and all their army by the setting on of the heathen
was killed or scattered.

Now Anna, son to Em, of the king's blood, was
their successor in the kingdom, a man of great virtue
and the father of a virtuous issue, of whom we must
speak in their proper time hereafter: and this king
himself also was afterwards slain of the same heathen
captain of the Marchmen, by whom too his predeces-
sors were slain.

st. Fursa, which Bede refers to.
