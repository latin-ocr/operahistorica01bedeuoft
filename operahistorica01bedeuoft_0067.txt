CASSIVELLAUNUS

were overthrown of the Britons‚ and Labienus,l one
of his colonels‚ slain: at the second eneounter, with
great loss and danger of his army, he routed the
Britons and put them to ssight: from thence he set
out to the river Thames. On the farther side thereof
a vast host of the Britons warded the banks under
Cassivellaunus their captain, which had sticked the
bank of the river and well-nigh all the ford 2 thick
of sharpened stakes, of which stakes certain remnants
unto this day are to be seen on the same spot, and
it is plain to view that each of them (of the bigness
of a man's thigh and covered with lead) had been
sticked fast in the bottom of the river: which when
the Romans had espied and escaped, the barbarians
not being able to stand the assault of the legions,
hid themselves in the woods; out of which they often
breaking out many times greatly endomaged the
Romans. In the meantime the mighty state of the
T rinovantes with their captain Androgius3 yielded
unto Caesar, delivering 40 hostages: which example
other more cities following fell in league with the
Romans. By advertisement of the same cities Caesar
having intelligence of a stronghold that Cassivellaunus
had builded between two marishes (well fenced beside
with the cover of woods and farsed with plenty of all
things) assailed it with great force and at length
overcame it. After that returning from Britain into
Gaul, having dismissed his army for the winter
season, he was suddenly beset with great tumults
of war raised against him on every sides*
